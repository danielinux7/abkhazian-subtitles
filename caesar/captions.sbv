0:00:16.219,0:00:19.682
Citizens of Rome, gather round!

0:00:20.224,0:00:25.062
Welcome to Gordian. Now, Gordian
was famous for its knot.

0:00:25.938,0:00:28.267
And the oracle one day prophesied...

0:00:28.357,0:00:32.960
...whosoever shall untie the knot
shall conquer the entire world.

0:00:33.738,0:00:37.914
Many people came from far and wide
but no one could untie it,

0:00:38.075,0:00:42.134
until one day the
mighty Alexander arrived!

0:00:42.204,0:00:46.720
Alexander, descended from
the mighty god Apollo!

0:01:06.478,0:01:08.279
Advance!

0:01:17.531,0:01:20.777
Apollo enlightened Alexander...

0:01:20.819,0:01:24.649
...and showed him how
to untie the knot.

0:01:47.936,0:01:52.400
Sulla has returned to Rome
to establish order!

0:01:52.442,0:01:55.792
He declares that the innocent
have no reason to fear!

0:01:55.834,0:01:59.092
But that those guilty
of crimes against him...

0:01:59.134,0:02:01.469
...shall be most severely punished!

0:02:02.409,0:02:07.795
The men whose names are written
on these lists are declared outlaws!

0:02:08.070,0:02:11.107
They have no rights
as citizens henceforth...

0:02:11.149,0:02:13.381
...they may be killed on sight!

0:02:13.753,0:02:17.637
Anyone who takes it upon himself
to kill any of these men...

0:02:17.933,0:02:20.523
...will be considered
a friend of the state...

0:02:20.565,0:02:23.227
...and shall be rewarded
with the property...

0:02:23.269,0:02:26.483
...and possessions
these outlaws leave behind.

0:02:34.209,0:02:36.738
It's the greatest crime of Roman law.

0:02:57.896,0:03:02.274
Rome, 82 BC

0:03:11.977,0:03:13.696
- Mother?
- Cornelia?

0:03:14.730,0:03:16.270
Mother?

0:03:16.858,0:03:19.256
- Where's my wife?
- At her fathers.

0:03:19.298,0:03:23.254
- Grandmother, the soldiers are coming.
- Julia... stay with her.

0:03:26.242,0:03:28.718
Sulla has taken the city
with his army.

0:03:28.869,0:03:31.894
He's made lists. Hundreds
of people are on them.

0:03:31.936,0:03:34.725
- Are you?
- No, my wife's father is.

0:03:34.959,0:03:37.182
Julia stay in the house!

0:03:37.670,0:03:38.970
Don't go!

0:03:39.400,0:03:40.935
Father, where are you going?

0:03:41.195,0:03:42.793
To get your mother!

0:04:01.193,0:04:02.861
He's not on the list!

0:04:04.321,0:04:06.907
- He's the one you want to, over there!
- Where?

0:04:49.741,0:04:52.766
- Have you heard?
- Yes, we have to hurry.

0:04:52.808,0:04:56.179
What's the point running away,
might as well... die right here!

0:04:56.268,0:04:58.842
- Please go.
- She's right Cinna...

0:04:58.884,0:05:00.310
- ...you must leave now.
- Cinna!

0:05:01.646,0:05:02.764
Hurry!

0:05:07.676,0:05:09.024
Go!

0:05:09.534,0:05:11.344
Please, father.

0:05:14.766,0:05:16.309
Go, hurry!

0:05:27.904,0:05:29.280
Go!

0:05:31.533,0:05:33.755
Please, Cornelia, run!

0:05:47.507,0:05:49.315
He helped Cinna to escape!

0:05:53.888,0:05:55.373
Give me your name.

0:05:56.224,0:05:59.567
It's Caesar,
from the House of Julii.

0:06:01.771,0:06:03.457
Arrest him.

0:06:15.316,0:06:17.093
No, no! Please, no!

0:06:17.419,0:06:19.132
No! No! No!

0:06:22.750,0:06:24.794
Please, please, no!

0:06:25.346,0:06:27.307
No, please, please, no!

0:06:27.748,0:06:29.331
No, please, no!

0:06:40.533,0:06:43.913
It's in any ruler's interest
to keep peace among the people.

0:06:44.183,0:06:45.937
And the people
will only be at peace...

0:06:46.528,0:06:48.874
...if they have
a Senate representative.

0:06:48.991,0:06:52.666
Since when did the Senate
ever represent the people?

0:07:10.279,0:07:12.529
Cato, why is your mouth
hanging open?

0:07:12.684,0:07:15.868
You have nothing to fear.
You are not on my list.

0:07:15.982,0:07:19.941
Sir, if I were on your list
and if it were for the good of Rome...

0:07:22.492,0:07:24.492
...I would gladly die.

0:07:24.930,0:07:29.420
Well, when you say that,
I truly believe it to be true.

0:07:31.922,0:07:34.376
So, I repeat:

0:07:35.003,0:07:38.418
When did the Senate
ever represent the people?

0:07:39.600,0:07:44.386
I want the man with
the humblest upbringing...

0:07:44.834,0:07:46.528
...to answer me.

0:07:51.860,0:07:53.006
You?

0:07:54.105,0:07:55.154
You?

0:08:02.205,0:08:05.280
So it's me. I will answer you.

0:08:07.584,0:08:09.366
You are all aristocrats.

0:08:09.991,0:08:13.119
Your feet have never touched the ground,
your ass has never touched a horse...

0:08:13.161,0:08:14.786
How can you possibly...

0:08:15.691,0:08:19.126
...represent the people whom
most of you have never even met!

0:08:19.296,0:08:22.255
We represent the people
by preserving their traditions.

0:08:22.771,0:08:24.911
- If they think you want to be king...
- King?

0:08:24.953,0:08:27.229
You said... king?

0:08:28.435,0:08:32.257
What would the name "King" buy me
that I don't already have?

0:08:32.383,0:08:36.407
Yeah, if the people know the Senate
is still meeting to advise you...

0:08:36.448,0:08:39.231
Oh, yes, oh, yes. Oh, they will.

0:08:39.980,0:08:43.153
That is my... fondest wish.

0:08:44.440,0:08:45.695
So,

0:08:45.792,0:08:49.707
I would not be a true Republican...

0:08:50.277,0:08:53.664
if I did not introduce a...
how do I say it?

0:08:53.721,0:08:56.875
A... earthier element...

0:08:57.373,0:08:59.165
...among your ranks

0:09:00.390,0:09:01.926
Gentlemen?

0:09:19.779,0:09:23.575
You will continue to advise me
and you will continue to debate...

0:09:24.052,0:09:26.569
...what is best
for the people, but...

0:09:26.691,0:09:29.736
...my men will remain here...

0:09:29.750,0:09:32.642
...just to make sure that
the decisions that you reach...

0:09:33.785,0:09:35.963
- ...aren't a problem.
- But, sir...

0:09:36.163,0:09:38.706
...is this not counter to Roman law?

0:09:38.956,0:09:42.174
I have just changed... Roman law.

0:09:44.903,0:09:46.422
I understand, sir.

0:09:47.268,0:09:50.055
But will something of
the old ways be preserved?

0:09:50.722,0:09:53.474
What Tallis means is,
not that we would ask you to pardon...

0:09:53.516,0:09:56.558
...anyone whom you've
resolved to destroy.

0:09:56.606,0:10:00.360
Only that it might have a calming effect
if you could make known...

0:10:01.564,0:10:03.363
...whom you intend to spare.

0:10:03.646,0:10:05.740
Oh, come, come Cato.

0:10:06.277,0:10:11.661
You know how alliances change
in troubled times.

0:10:13.157,0:10:14.402
Well, then,

0:10:14.740,0:10:18.130
perhaps you can tell us
who you intend to kill.

0:10:23.926,0:10:25.255
Well, let's...

0:10:26.577,0:10:28.142
...begin with you.

0:10:30.718,0:10:32.340
I was only asking...

0:10:33.062,0:10:34.824
...what everyone was thinking.

0:10:34.840,0:10:37.192
Well, I can't possibly kill everyone.

0:10:37.683,0:10:40.489
So, I will kill only you.

0:10:42.422,0:10:45.994
I may be true at that.
Then again I may not.

0:10:46.650,0:10:49.864
I will let you know after dinner,

0:10:51.159,0:10:52.397
but for your sake...

0:10:53.154,0:10:55.003
...you better hope
that the food is good.

0:11:22.463,0:11:24.757
- Are you Julius Caesar?
- Yes.

0:11:31.772,0:11:33.074
This way.

0:11:46.708,0:11:47.979
This way.

0:11:53.354,0:11:55.907
I want to see Sulla! Please!

0:11:56.162,0:11:59.043
No! I want to see Sulla!

0:11:59.409,0:12:02.494
I've been a member of the Senate
for thirty years!

0:12:02.505,0:12:05.920
I want to see Sulla!
Take me to Sulla!

0:12:12.486,0:12:14.863
That is not... negotiable.

0:12:18.867,0:12:20.410
Who is he?

0:12:22.371,0:12:24.304
Julius Caesar.

0:12:27.584,0:12:29.419
Nephew to Marius?

0:12:43.391,0:12:46.378
You have unfortunate ancestry.

0:12:46.645,0:12:49.586
If you think it's unfortunate
to be descendent from the gods.

0:12:50.982,0:12:52.543
Oh, which god was that?

0:12:52.797,0:12:55.140
The Julians are descendent
from Aeneas, who was...

0:12:55.182,0:12:57.761
The son of Venus,
ah, yes yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

0:12:57.864,0:13:00.346
I recall Marius making such claim.

0:13:00.742,0:13:03.954
There are many people these days
who claim to be descendent from the gods.

0:13:04.496,0:13:06.278
We have a crest which proves it.

0:13:07.415,0:13:10.418
I believe you can have them
fashioned in the marketplace for...

0:13:11.169,0:13:12.931
...a couple of dinars.

0:13:14.589,0:13:16.485
Why did you ask to see me?

0:13:17.592,0:13:19.844
Your mother...
she came to see me.

0:13:20.386,0:13:24.015
Did she... ask you to spare my life,
and what, you agreed?

0:13:24.487,0:13:25.698
Well,

0:13:26.100,0:13:30.187
I promised that
I would... consider it.

0:13:30.271,0:13:31.914
And I'm supposed
to be grateful to you?

0:13:31.956,0:13:33.131
No.

0:13:33.650,0:13:37.297
- She is. We are old friends.
- You've killed a lot of old friends.

0:13:37.340,0:13:40.156
Oh, yes, true. True, true.

0:13:40.573,0:13:43.868
Old friends in the day
become fresh enemies at night.

0:13:44.369,0:13:46.606
What do you want
in exchange for my life?

0:13:48.081,0:13:50.737
Why do you think I want
anything in exchange?

0:13:51.167,0:13:53.770
And like you don't give
things away for free.

0:13:55.004,0:13:58.955
I'm not a man without compassion.
I will help you if I can.

0:14:00.510,0:14:02.816
First you must understand
the gravity of the crime.

0:14:02.887,0:14:05.869
Cinna was my greatest enemy,
and you helped him to escape.

0:14:05.932,0:14:07.141
Did he?

0:14:07.392,0:14:08.659
Of course not.

0:14:09.310,0:14:13.765
He did escape my soldiers only
to be killed by one of his servants.

0:14:15.733,0:14:18.010
- My wife?
- She's well.

0:14:19.070,0:14:21.261
I leave women to the health.

0:14:21.572,0:14:25.951
And since you are only the son
of Cinna by marriage,

0:14:26.151,0:14:28.191
I intend to leave you to yours.

0:14:28.788,0:14:29.872
If?

0:14:38.380,0:14:41.791
If you divorce... your wife.

0:14:46.513,0:14:47.995
Well?

0:14:50.059,0:14:53.922
- No. I refuse!
- You refuse to divorce your wife...

0:14:53.964,0:14:55.782
...even though it may
cost you your life?

0:14:55.898,0:14:57.719
My wife is my teacher.

0:14:59.443,0:15:02.637
She's cleverer than I am,
she's more honest than I am,

0:15:02.738,0:15:06.258
she's a more compelling argument
than I am or you are...

0:15:06.408,0:15:08.353
...or your office is.

0:15:09.995,0:15:11.684
I won't divorce her.

0:15:12.414,0:15:16.020
- That is my answer.
- Oh, Pompey...

0:15:16.585,0:15:19.213
...what do we do
with men such as this?

0:15:19.505,0:15:23.366
I don't know weather to...
embrace him or strangle him.

0:15:24.843,0:15:26.787
I think we should let him go.

0:15:27.158,0:15:28.325
What?

0:15:28.680,0:15:31.516
His uncle Marius
was my greatest enemy.

0:15:31.808,0:15:35.479
He's got ten Mariuses inside him.
Look at his eyes.

0:15:36.104,0:15:38.009
You want to let him go?

0:15:38.051,0:15:41.308
It's the ones who smile and flatter
you should worry about.

0:15:42.694,0:15:44.503
He speaks plainly.

0:15:45.322,0:15:47.633
You do speak plainly, don't you?

0:15:47.657,0:15:49.451
Always.

0:15:49.743,0:15:50.935
Well, tell me...

0:15:51.870,0:15:55.426
...would you kill me if you could?

0:15:57.209,0:15:59.024
In an instant.

0:16:06.343,0:16:07.864
You can go.

0:16:08.762,0:16:11.587
I said you are free to go.

0:16:23.693,0:16:26.946
What a big heart that boy has.

0:16:27.947,0:16:30.433
Bring it to me in the morning.

0:17:46.233,0:17:48.222
Was this Sulla's plan?

0:17:48.264,0:17:51.115
To slaughter me outside so I wouldn't foul
the carpet with my blood?

0:17:51.155,0:17:53.741
- I came to warn you.
- Why?

0:17:54.325,0:17:57.099
Because if you don't leave Rome
I'll have to do as he asked.

0:17:57.286,0:17:58.548
And?

0:17:59.622,0:18:01.893
And I don't want to see men
like you die young.

0:18:02.082,0:18:03.765
What do you know about me?

0:18:03.820,0:18:05.401
You refused Sulla.

0:18:07.087,0:18:09.737
I'll tell you more
some day when is time,

0:18:09.779,0:18:11.499
but now you must leave Rome.

0:18:12.217,0:18:15.676
Your family will be safe,
here, take this.

0:18:15.718,0:18:19.288
Go east to Bithynia.
Show this ring to Nicomedes.

0:18:19.539,0:18:21.626
He'll keep you safe in his service.

0:18:23.395,0:18:26.348
- How do I know I can trust you?
- You don't.

0:18:31.153,0:18:33.772
I will not hand my fate
over to that man.

0:18:33.923,0:18:35.574
So you'd let him kill you?

0:18:35.616,0:18:38.244
He can try if he wants,
I'm not leaving Rome.

0:18:38.660,0:18:40.607
Why must you be so stubborn!

0:18:40.662,0:18:43.937
Pompey himself came to offer you help.
Why won't you accept it?

0:18:43.979,0:18:46.233
He's Sulla's man,
it could be a trick.

0:18:47.002,0:18:49.062
Don't you trust anyone at all?

0:18:49.537,0:18:50.733
Yes.

0:18:52.174,0:18:55.058
- I trust you.
- Then listen to me.

0:18:56.261,0:18:59.806
You're not the heaven and the earth.
You're just a man.

0:19:00.515,0:19:02.918
And some things
are bigger than you are.

0:19:07.689,0:19:09.719
When you were in jail...

0:19:10.567,0:19:12.611
...I thought you were dead.

0:19:13.528,0:19:16.197
I started to grieve your death.

0:19:16.948,0:19:19.701
I'm asking you
to spare me that, Caesar.

0:19:21.786,0:19:26.272
How can I live with myself if I knew
I had one chance to save your life,

0:19:26.292,0:19:27.617
and I failed!

0:20:38.404,0:20:41.733
- Is this pig for sale?
- How much will you give me for it?

0:20:42.199,0:20:45.490
- Ten dinars.
- That's good money for a swine.

0:20:46.745,0:20:48.603
It requires carving.

0:20:50.708,0:20:52.126
Julius Caesar.

0:21:05.806,0:21:08.714
We will feed it to my dogs.

0:21:29.603,0:21:31.435
That's the coast of Crete.

0:21:31.999,0:21:34.489
The ruler there
used to make up laws...

0:21:34.531,0:21:37.212
...and then hang them so high
that people couldn't read them.

0:21:38.046,0:21:41.251
And if they broke the law
he'd show then no mercy.

0:21:41.967,0:21:44.744
Today the shores
are infected by pirates.

0:21:46.596,0:21:48.659
We need to anchor for the night.

0:22:44.511,0:22:46.357
Where has father gone?

0:22:46.364,0:22:48.416
The other side of the water.

0:22:48.658,0:22:51.146
How long does it take
to cross the water?

0:22:52.036,0:22:53.746
Depends on the wind.

0:22:54.706,0:22:57.359
Sometimes you can cross it in days.

0:22:58.418,0:23:02.547
Sometimes if the air is still
you may not move at all.

0:23:20.022,0:23:23.597
If you don't like the rope, sir
we could use nails.

0:23:23.901,0:23:25.811
It's the Roman way, isn't it?

0:23:26.279,0:23:29.814
What kind of ransom do you get
for a Roman these days?

0:23:30.366,0:23:31.993
Two talents.

0:23:32.285,0:23:35.233
But I'll pay three
to watch a Roman drowned.

0:23:35.496,0:23:37.781
You'd get fifty for me alive.

0:23:39.834,0:23:41.742
And who would collect it?

0:23:44.839,0:23:46.621
They would.

0:24:06.843,0:24:08.022
Hey!

0:24:09.822,0:24:11.156
If your men...

0:24:11.824,0:24:13.756
...don't return before dawn...

0:24:15.119,0:24:16.805
...you die.

0:24:46.525,0:24:48.443
Your time is up, Roman.

0:24:50.404,0:24:52.981
I'll fight one of you
for another day.

0:25:31.051,0:25:32.478
That's another day.

0:26:09.607,0:26:12.019
Nobody is coming back
for this Roman.

0:26:13.236,0:26:15.071
Throw him in the sea.

0:26:19.325,0:26:20.841
Ship!

0:26:47.687,0:26:49.500
Fifty talents.

0:27:15.214,0:27:18.465
And the money just happened
to find it's way into your purse?

0:27:18.507,0:27:20.458
Sir, I never stole a coin from you.

0:27:20.470,0:27:24.286
And I suppose it was the goldsmiths
who just happened to rob me again.

0:27:24.328,0:27:27.190
- Sir, they've been convicted for it.
- I know how these things work!

0:27:27.499,0:27:29.147
You share the profits
with these men.

0:27:29.189,0:27:33.116
You pay me well, I would never
risk my life for a gold coin!

0:27:33.565,0:27:36.814
This is the magistrate's testament,
the goldsmiths have confessed.

0:27:36.856,0:27:38.644
Flavius had nothing to do with it.

0:27:38.686,0:27:41.431
Are you trying to tell me that
a man who handles so much gold,

0:27:41.473,0:27:43.391
never put a piece into his pocket?

0:27:44.159,0:27:47.621
He's been proven innocent.
This needs your signet.

0:27:49.831,0:27:52.334
- Strangle him.
- Wait!

0:27:54.002,0:27:56.614
He's been proven innocent.

0:27:56.922,0:28:00.587
Well, I just... disapprove
of the verdict.

0:28:02.427,0:28:03.970
Sulla...

0:28:05.097,0:28:08.335
...he's a good man,
and he's here on my introduction.

0:28:08.392,0:28:11.734
Allow me to vouch for him
and to protect him.

0:28:11.776,0:28:14.497
You can vouch for him all you like,

0:28:15.565,0:28:18.807
but protect him you can't.

0:28:19.528,0:28:23.874
The penalty for theft is
strangulation. Strangle him.

0:28:23.899,0:28:25.927
There seems to be
an error of judgment.

0:28:27.535,0:28:29.070
My judgment?

0:28:33.792,0:28:35.234
Pompey...

0:28:36.378,0:28:39.297
...you're becoming very critical.

0:28:39.798,0:28:43.843
And you want to rise above me.
Just are just waiting for your chance.

0:28:44.135,0:28:48.705
Those men worship the rising sun
and not the setting sun.

0:28:49.974,0:28:52.267
That's how the saying goes isn't it?

0:28:53.561,0:28:56.424
But I am not the setting sun,
not yet, and in the meantime...

0:28:56.523,0:28:59.183
...I expect you to
subordinate yourself...

0:28:59.225,0:29:01.969
...to my wishes weather
you understand them...

0:29:02.612,0:29:03.811
...or not.

0:29:05.740,0:29:07.527
Strangle him!

0:29:09.118,0:29:10.411
No.

0:29:11.037,0:29:12.733
You.

0:29:13.373,0:29:16.398
You will strangle him.

0:29:29.180,0:29:30.421
No.

0:29:30.723,0:29:33.675
Did I hear...
Did you hear him say no?

0:29:37.230,0:29:40.020
Ah, my dear general.

0:29:40.149,0:29:44.973
I asked you to strangle Flavius
and strangle Flavius you will.

0:29:45.015,0:29:48.271
And you will do it
with your own bare hands.

0:29:57.249,0:30:00.317
You will strangle Flavius...

0:30:00.359,0:30:03.515
...or you yourself
will be strangled.

0:30:07.635,0:30:09.161
Strangle him!

0:30:12.348,0:30:14.262
Strangle him now!

0:30:15.226,0:30:17.814
I will not have my orders disobeyed!

0:30:18.312,0:30:19.563
I swear to...

0:30:50.365,0:30:53.785
KINGDOM OF BITHYNIA
PROVINCE OF ASIA

0:31:01.006,0:31:05.173
...by the prince of Egypt!
Noble of stature!

0:31:05.350,0:31:08.251
Fit to serve a gentleman
such as yourself, sir!

0:31:14.775,0:31:16.520
Ah, here, sir.

0:31:16.619,0:31:20.318
This young girl, new from the North,

0:31:20.340,0:31:23.078
will have special ways
of delighting their masters,

0:31:23.120,0:31:25.821
and young enough for you
to teach her a few your own.

0:31:28.125,0:31:30.694
Oh, no. No, no, no, sir.

0:31:30.831,0:31:34.502
This... hardly able to lift
a bucket of wine unassisted.

0:31:34.836,0:31:36.526
He'll disagree
with everything you say.

0:31:36.922,0:31:40.123
He's unfortunately skilled
in the arts of the tongue.

0:31:41.682,0:31:43.818
And what arts of the tongue
are you versed?

0:31:44.307,0:31:46.607
In the arts of Euclid and Aristotle.

0:31:47.354,0:31:48.886
The arts of verse.

0:31:49.069,0:31:52.740
I can recite verse of Homer
from memory, and all of Pindar.

0:31:53.558,0:31:55.522
The arts of politics and the state.

0:31:55.931,0:32:00.614
Logic, metaphysics, epistemology
rhetoric and sophistry.

0:32:00.821,0:32:01.957
Sophistry?

0:32:02.538,0:32:05.197
Now, doesn't that mean you know
how to tell fancy lines?

0:32:05.912,0:32:08.320
There's great power in ambiguity, sir,

0:32:08.819,0:32:11.824
but not all men use advantages
to wicked ends.

0:32:14.364,0:32:16.406
Are you experienced
teaching the young?

0:32:17.412,0:32:18.537
Yes.

0:32:18.841,0:32:22.010
- I much prefer to teach in the old.
- Why is that?

0:32:22.052,0:32:24.256
Because they exhibit more wisdom.

0:33:50.384,0:33:51.814
Father.

0:34:00.685,0:34:02.076
Who are your friends?

0:34:02.187,0:34:04.820
Portia and Marcus.
Don't you remember them?

0:34:04.856,0:34:08.368
Of course, Cato's children.
Just don't grown so much.

0:34:08.694,0:34:10.144
That's our cousin.

0:34:11.780,0:34:13.221
Brutus.

0:34:14.824,0:34:16.797
- What you reading?
- "Ethics."

0:34:17.119,0:34:19.996
- Aristotle?
- My uncle Cato gave it to me.

0:34:20.079,0:34:22.749
- How is he?
- He's as grumpy as ever.

0:34:22.916,0:34:24.962
- Hasn't changed a bit.
- Mother.

0:34:29.016,0:34:31.845
Father, did you bring me
anything back from the East?

0:34:33.397,0:34:36.014
Did I bring you back anything? Yes.

0:34:36.561,0:34:37.819
I brought you this.

0:34:37.856,0:34:39.322
Apollonius?

0:34:40.483,0:34:42.301
This is my daughter Julia.

0:34:44.143,0:34:46.011
Apollonius will be your teacher.

0:34:51.164,0:34:52.317
Where's my wife?

0:35:03.247,0:35:04.791
Caesar!

0:35:06.250,0:35:08.380
- Don't get up.
- I'm not ill.

0:35:19.764,0:35:21.599
Let me get dressed.

0:35:29.565,0:35:32.485
I'm well, I just stood up too fast.

0:35:32.500,0:35:34.698
You don't have to get dressed.
Let's lie down together.

0:35:34.720,0:35:36.225
No, wait.

0:35:37.490,0:35:38.741
Just...

0:35:41.035,0:35:42.328
Cornelia.

0:35:42.661,0:35:45.009
I never stopped waiting for you.

0:35:47.166,0:35:49.669
I never stopped missing you.

0:35:50.711,0:35:52.046
And now...

0:35:54.840,0:35:56.300
Here.

0:35:57.301,0:36:00.023
This is not supposed to happen.

0:36:04.350,0:36:06.894
I'm back now, my love.

0:36:09.772,0:36:12.244
Two years is just too long.

0:36:14.860,0:36:17.609
There are those of you
who worked with Sulla,

0:36:18.655,0:36:20.907
and those of you who worked...

0:36:23.035,0:36:24.588
...against him.

0:36:25.996,0:36:29.847
But not all who worked with him
agreed with his laws.

0:36:32.336,0:36:36.133
I therefore propose that the rights
of the tribunes be restored,

0:36:36.214,0:36:39.214
so that once again the people
can be fairly represented.

0:36:39.348,0:36:40.776
Yes!

0:36:43.430,0:36:46.016
I propose a thorough
reform of the courts...

0:36:48.518,0:36:52.439
...and an unqualified
reinstatement of the Senate,

0:36:53.482,0:36:56.331
as the principal body of government.

0:36:56.489,0:36:58.288
- Yeah!
- Yes!

0:37:19.549,0:37:20.884
Caesar!

0:37:22.761,0:37:25.475
It's good to see you fresh
from another victory.

0:37:26.181,0:37:29.442
Oh, he lets me win.
It makes me feel old.

0:37:31.853,0:37:33.980
I'm glad to see
you made it back safely.

0:37:34.314,0:37:37.456
I hear you met with
a number of... obstacles.

0:37:37.567,0:37:42.027
Yes. Fortunately your friend Nicomedes
has proven to be a great ally.

0:37:44.115,0:37:46.011
I never had a chance to thank you...

0:37:46.951,0:37:48.328
...for saving my life.

0:37:48.870,0:37:50.377
You defied Sulla.

0:37:51.469,0:37:53.526
He told you to divorce
your wife and you said no...

0:37:53.551,0:37:55.525
...even though you knew
it meant certain death.

0:37:56.044,0:37:57.588
That impressed me.

0:37:57.837,0:37:59.131
And it...

0:38:00.259,0:38:01.884
...reminded me of something.

0:38:02.550,0:38:03.968
You see my friend,

0:38:04.427,0:38:08.094
Sulla once... told me
to divorce my wife.

0:38:08.598,0:38:10.878
And unlike you I obeyed him.

0:38:11.767,0:38:14.236
I left the one woman I loved.

0:38:17.607,0:38:19.729
Life is full of lessons.

0:38:20.276,0:38:23.696
So, we taught each other
a thing of two.

0:38:24.905,0:38:27.238
Tell me how to get
where you are now.

0:38:29.076,0:38:31.881
Don't tell me I was wrong
to hope you were spared.

0:38:32.121,0:38:34.243
See, I have something
to give to Rome...

0:38:35.791,0:38:37.499
...but I have no voice.

0:38:38.294,0:38:40.470
If you want a voice in Rome,

0:38:41.505,0:38:45.511
win the people,
speak from your heart...

0:38:46.594,0:38:50.230
...and when you make
a promise, keep it!

0:38:56.478,0:38:57.652
Pompey...

0:38:59.732,0:39:02.484
...I promise you
if you ever need my help...

0:39:02.776,0:39:05.609
...just give me a sign,
and I'll come to your aid.

0:39:10.448,0:39:12.866
- Man.
- Andras.

0:39:13.125,0:39:15.587
- Woman.
- Gynh.

0:39:16.375,0:39:17.682
Slave.

0:39:19.172,0:39:20.424
From memory.

0:39:20.631,0:39:22.440
Why do I have to learn Greek?

0:39:22.460,0:39:25.316
Because that is the greatest culture
the world has ever known.

0:39:25.336,0:39:27.036
- As in Rome?
- Much.

0:39:27.249,0:39:30.135
So is a Greek slave better
than a Roman free man?

0:39:32.395,0:39:34.571
I'm content to be what I am.

0:39:34.607,0:39:36.899
You can draw your own
conclusions from that.

0:39:37.034,0:39:38.718
But you'd rather be free?

0:39:38.718,0:39:40.662
All men would rather be free.

0:39:41.402,0:39:43.411
Because then you could do
what you wanted?

0:39:43.607,0:39:46.796
I can do what I want to do
even as a slave.

0:39:47.102,0:39:50.364
And some men who think they're free
are not free at all.

0:39:50.706,0:39:53.627
They're bound
by their own poor ideas.

0:39:53.688,0:39:56.498
'Cause if you're my slave
I'll set you free.

0:39:57.123,0:39:59.006
- Julia.
- Father!

0:39:59.048,0:40:01.569
If you'd set him free,
I'd have no one to educate you.

0:40:02.256,0:40:04.675
He could educate me
just the same, if he was free.

0:40:04.719,0:40:06.599
Ah, yes, but then
I couldn't afford him.

0:40:07.378,0:40:09.132
Sweet gods, come quick!

0:40:18.019,0:40:19.210
Cornelia?

0:40:19.813,0:40:20.990
Cornelia?

0:40:21.325,0:40:22.538
Cornelia?

0:40:23.986,0:40:25.668
Cornelia, wake up!

0:40:26.663,0:40:29.365
Oh, please, stay with me! No!

0:40:29.537,0:40:32.212
Cornelia! Please, my love!

0:40:33.628,0:40:35.003
Oh, god.

0:40:55.175,0:40:57.260
My name is Julius Caesar.

0:41:00.555,0:41:03.187
I'm here to honor
my wife, Cornelia...

0:41:04.183,0:41:06.954
...publicly and for the last time.

0:41:08.271,0:41:10.111
She was a good woman.

0:41:10.648,0:41:13.915
She gave no thought
to her own well being.

0:41:14.152,0:41:16.487
Only to the well being of others.

0:41:16.821,0:41:21.086
Rome was her first and greatest love.

0:41:21.951,0:41:23.926
We shared that love.

0:41:27.123,0:41:29.595
We dreamt of a Rome
without dictators.

0:41:30.251,0:41:33.214
Where sons never raise
their hands against fathers.

0:41:33.754,0:41:37.091
Where brothers never raise
their swords against brothers.

0:41:37.383,0:41:41.480
Where Romans lived at peace
with their fellow Romans by their side.

0:41:42.597,0:41:45.174
So I ask you now to join with me,

0:41:45.474,0:41:48.738
in honoring not only
the memory of my good wife,

0:41:48.894,0:41:51.282
but the memory of all
good men and women...

0:41:51.324,0:41:53.649
...who have died fighting
for a better Rome.

0:41:53.983,0:41:56.708
People of Rome, I, Julius Caesar,

0:41:56.750,0:42:00.205
make you this promise
on the body of my beloved wife:

0:42:00.948,0:42:06.015
I will not rest till the Rome
she dreamed of is the Rome we live in.

0:42:06.287,0:42:07.830
Join me!

0:42:08.789,0:42:12.098
For I am not only the nephew
to our beloved Marius,

0:42:12.414,0:42:16.543
who fought against the evils of Sulla
until Sulla took his life from him,

0:42:16.755,0:42:19.727
but I'm also a son of the Julius,

0:42:20.576,0:42:23.436
who was descended from
the goddess Venus herself.

0:42:24.783,0:42:26.105
I offer you my hand.

0:42:26.400,0:42:29.229
A power supreme among mortal men,

0:42:29.810,0:42:33.897
granted by the gods,
superior to kings!

0:42:35.363,0:42:37.492
Let us work together comrades,

0:42:37.526,0:42:41.506
in our quest for an empire,
that is boundless,

0:42:41.947,0:42:43.427
united...

0:42:44.537,0:42:45.928
...and free!

0:42:58.734,0:43:00.679
We shall have to watch him.

0:43:02.190,0:43:03.677
Or use him.

0:43:11.601,0:43:13.660
Good morning to you, Caesar.

0:43:13.680,0:43:14.787
- Good morning.
- Caesar!

0:43:15.032,0:43:16.168
Hail, Caesar!

0:43:17.475,0:43:18.741
Hail, Caesar!

0:43:20.145,0:43:21.630
Greetings, Caesar!

0:43:23.453,0:43:24.754
Hail, Caesar!

0:43:28.535,0:43:33.651
Greetings, Caesar.
Hey, Julia, I have something for you.

0:43:34.182,0:43:37.322
Now, then... Ah, here!

0:43:37.534,0:43:40.301
And I hope it will make you smile.

0:43:45.135,0:43:48.888
That's the first
I've seen you smile in weeks.

0:43:57.499,0:43:59.269
Stop it all of you!

0:43:59.440,0:44:02.208
There is nothing he can do about it!

0:44:05.718,0:44:07.047
What happened?

0:44:07.502,0:44:09.585
The price of bread is tripled.

0:44:10.045,0:44:12.641
- There's no grain in Rome.
- Why?

0:44:12.683,0:44:16.006
Because the grain supply from Egypt
was cut off by pirates.

0:44:16.351,0:44:18.636
Half Rome is without bread.

0:44:19.187,0:44:20.775
The city is close to panic.

0:44:20.804,0:44:23.017
Only the very rich can afford bread.

0:44:23.381,0:44:27.664
We must fight the pirates now
or Rome will be crippled forever.

0:44:28.061,0:44:32.070
So I propose that Pompey be given legions
to attack this problem...

0:44:32.112,0:44:33.617
...once and for all.

0:44:34.454,0:44:37.927
It's not a question of whether
or not we fight pirates,

0:44:37.969,0:44:39.281
it's a matter of how.

0:44:39.313,0:44:42.788
I propose we equip ten small armies...

0:44:42.870,0:44:45.205
...to fight the pirates
at different parts of the coast.

0:44:45.220,0:44:47.473
But the pirates can destroy Rome,
you want to buy time?

0:44:47.512,0:44:50.460
The pirates are a bunch
of uneducated hoodlums.

0:44:50.491,0:44:54.138
I hardly think they could withstand
a Roman assault of any size.

0:44:54.537,0:44:57.139
Let's talk about the way
things are gentlemen.

0:44:57.456,0:44:59.676
Not about the way
we'd like then to be.

0:44:59.709,0:45:02.819
I can attest to the threat posed
by these scavengers.

0:45:02.839,0:45:04.832
I was a victim of one
of their assaults myself.

0:45:05.186,0:45:09.068
Then perhaps you will regale us
with your sea stories Gaius Julius,

0:45:09.460,0:45:12.828
in the tavern after the work
of the Senate is done.

0:45:13.013,0:45:15.527
The work of the Senate
is rarely done.

0:45:16.475,0:45:19.166
You see there are not
thousands of pirates...

0:45:19.191,0:45:21.760
...in our waters,
but hundreds of thousands.

0:45:21.837,0:45:24.863
And not all the rogue bands
preying on single vessels.

0:45:25.237,0:45:27.217
There are pirate admirals, sea kings...

0:45:27.259,0:45:29.594
...with thousands of ships
and troops more skilled...

0:45:29.636,0:45:31.702
...in the naval combat
even than our own.

0:45:31.985,0:45:35.167
Pretty speeches like this
won't even cook our lunch!

0:45:35.209,0:45:37.371
No, speeches do as little
work as the Senate.

0:45:37.413,0:45:41.435
How dare this arrogant newcomer
insult this August body?

0:45:41.477,0:45:44.813
August and plump, Bibulus,
like your own body.

0:45:44.855,0:45:47.441
Fat from idle
chatter and inactivity.

0:45:49.902,0:45:51.900
Enough, enough... Enough!

0:45:53.011,0:45:56.133
We have a man in
our company who can...

0:45:56.323,0:45:58.830
...resolve this conflict
with the pirates.

0:45:58.934,0:46:01.250
But do we honor him
with that duty?

0:46:01.270,0:46:03.071
- No.
- I'm with Caesar...

0:46:03.113,0:46:04.415
...we have no bread.

0:46:05.023,0:46:07.318
Now are we a great empire or...

0:46:07.959,0:46:09.995
...are we going
to be ruled by outlaws?

0:46:11.780,0:46:13.704
To perform this commission,

0:46:13.740,0:46:17.244
Pompey will have to be given
an army twice the size...

0:46:17.536,0:46:19.970
...of the one Sulla used
to take Rome.

0:46:21.164,0:46:23.898
Have we learned
nothing from the past?

0:46:30.507,0:46:31.973
I see.

0:46:32.015,0:46:36.330
Rome should go hungry because Cato
can't find a single man he can trust.

0:46:36.680,0:46:39.531
Not any man with an army
would take the state.

0:46:41.226,0:46:43.335
Not every man is a Sulla.

0:46:43.353,0:46:46.660
Some men are ruled by circumstance
but men of character...

0:46:46.702,0:46:49.327
...bend circumstances to their will.

0:46:50.826,0:46:53.170
They make nature
behave in such a way...

0:46:53.212,0:46:55.420
...that their will is carried out
on this earth.

0:46:55.462,0:46:56.845
They defy the elements,

0:46:56.866,0:47:00.057
and sometimes even defy
their own baser nature,

0:47:00.245,0:47:02.378
in order to see that their ideals...

0:47:02.838,0:47:04.609
...come alive before their eyes.

0:47:07.502,0:47:09.601
Pompey is such a man.

0:47:10.672,0:47:12.359
Those of you who have lived...

0:47:12.944,0:47:15.568
...know that one thing alone
keeps the nation small.

0:47:16.821,0:47:18.314
Civil strife.

0:47:18.930,0:47:22.445
Tribes fighting tribes rather than
banding together...

0:47:22.487,0:47:23.767
...in one arm of power.

0:47:23.768,0:47:26.949
As long as we fight in this room...

0:47:26.991,0:47:31.117
...seeking personal victories,
enacting petty revenges,

0:47:31.159,0:47:34.250
Rome will stay small!

0:47:36.458,0:47:38.907
I propose we put our opinions aside...

0:47:38.949,0:47:41.854
...and let one feeling
rule us for a time:

0:47:42.620,0:47:44.967
The love of Rome.

0:47:46.385,0:47:49.596
I propose we put our strengths
together to become a force...

0:47:49.669,0:47:52.231
...the world has never seen.

0:47:54.143,0:47:55.782
I propose we let a man...

0:47:56.050,0:47:57.686
...a single man,

0:47:58.898,0:48:00.356
lead us out of the dark.

0:48:03.650,0:48:05.153
I propose Pompey.

0:48:08.832,0:48:10.244
All those in favor.

0:48:22.768,0:48:25.598
Can we come inside?
You said me we could.

0:48:25.874,0:48:28.779
Why, there's nothing but a bunch
of dusty old senators in here.

0:48:28.931,0:48:30.479
Is the consul in there?

0:48:32.056,0:48:34.345
Yes, this is consul Gnaeus Pompey.

0:48:35.024,0:48:36.321
And who is this?

0:48:36.341,0:48:37.767
This is my daughter Julia.

0:48:37.809,0:48:40.858
And Apollonius,
the wisdom of our household.

0:48:41.406,0:48:45.729
Julia, your father has just proved to us
he'll have my job one day.

0:48:46.283,0:48:48.579
- But don't think it's all fun.
- Why?

0:48:48.904,0:48:51.285
Because he'll always have
these men around him.

0:48:51.672,0:48:53.094
They're silly looking old men.

0:48:58.428,0:49:00.315
I'll see when I return.

0:49:00.921,0:49:02.211
In triumph.

0:49:25.210,0:49:26.947
Apollonius says...

0:49:26.989,0:49:30.739
...that when we die, our soul goes
to a place where everything is perfect.

0:49:31.500,0:49:33.778
All the beds are perfect beds,

0:49:34.714,0:49:37.049
all the circles are perfectly round.

0:49:51.888,0:49:55.889
YEARS LATER

0:50:03.936,0:50:05.524
- Marcus!
- Julia.

0:50:08.530,0:50:11.232
Julia... look at you.

0:50:13.619,0:50:16.745
Brutus, wake up and tell Julia
how beautiful she looks.

0:50:16.914,0:50:19.212
- Beautiful.
- Do you like it?

0:50:19.249,0:50:21.250
All dressed for Pompey's triumph.

0:50:23.054,0:50:24.847
Has Apollonius returned?

0:50:25.007,0:50:27.137
I wanted to talk to him about Plato.

0:50:27.785,0:50:29.729
No, he hasn't returned.

0:50:29.802,0:50:32.222
I'll bet he ran off to fight
with the rebel slaves.

0:50:32.717,0:50:35.230
Those rebel slaves
are not like Apollonius.

0:50:35.286,0:50:37.391
They aren't educated men
with happy homes.

0:50:37.471,0:50:40.280
Well, we had a Moorish cook
who ran off a month ago.

0:50:40.486,0:50:43.192
We heard he joined the rebels,
and that was made commander.

0:50:43.278,0:50:45.755
From cook to commander,
it's so inspiring!

0:50:45.785,0:50:47.610
You talk as if it's a game.

0:50:48.000,0:50:49.117
I don't.

0:50:49.581,0:50:50.736
Think about it.

0:50:51.096,0:50:54.412
At least half of the population of Rome
is made up of slaves.

0:50:55.079,0:50:57.994
And what would happen
if they all decided to rebel?

0:50:58.871,0:51:00.212
It would be the end of Rome.

0:51:00.424,0:51:02.076
Rome had to act.

0:51:02.778,0:51:04.007
What do you mean?

0:51:04.087,0:51:07.971
Pompey... he defeated 20,000 of them
on his way back to Rome.

0:51:07.994,0:51:09.224
I was going with you.

0:51:12.281,0:51:14.926
None of you wants to join
the consul of Rome?

0:51:17.870,0:51:20.466
No offense, father,
but do you really think...

0:51:20.486,0:51:23.156
...we're going to trail along
with your lectors around.

0:51:23.250,0:51:26.985
Rome's greatest general returns and...
we want to be free to run...

0:51:27.027,0:51:28.755
- ...and follow him.
- Run, yes. Run, run.

0:51:29.423,0:51:30.995
Go, enjoy yourselves.

0:51:32.384,0:51:34.177
- Come on.
- Thank you Consul.

0:51:35.345,0:51:36.496
Brutus?

0:51:37.371,0:51:38.547
Aren't you going with them?

0:51:38.557,0:51:41.335
- I wanted to return this to Apollonius.
- What's this?

0:51:41.643,0:51:43.506
Ah, yes, Plato's Law.

0:51:43.843,0:51:45.254
- Did you read it?
- Yes.

0:51:45.522,0:51:46.773
And?

0:51:47.274,0:51:50.504
Well, Plato thinks that democracy
is doomed to failure.

0:51:50.611,0:51:53.892
He thinks that a state
should be run by a dictator.

0:51:54.197,0:51:58.854
A dictator who's become enlightened
through experience and learning.

0:51:58.896,0:52:01.905
I don't think Plato would get along
very well with your uncle Cato.

0:52:03.039,0:52:05.975
- Brutus! Hurry up!
- Come on!

0:52:06.710,0:52:09.727
Hurry and catch up with your friends
or you'll have to come along with me.

0:52:09.769,0:52:11.789
- See you at the ceremony.
- Hurry up!

0:52:12.966,0:52:14.416
Goodbye, father!

0:52:15.635,0:52:17.220

0:53:07.351,0:53:19.976
Pompey! Pompey! Pompey! Pompey!

0:54:03.192,0:54:11.197
Pompey! Pompey! Pompey! Pompey!

0:55:04.949,0:55:06.712
Thank you for your kindness.

0:55:08.431,0:55:10.956
Let me take care of my son now.

0:55:26.842,0:55:28.220
Who are these people?

0:55:28.319,0:55:30.805
- Prisoners.
- Pirates?

0:55:30.842,0:55:33.734
Pirates and slaves.
Rebellious slaves.

0:55:50.116,0:55:52.565
Apollonius! Apollonius!

0:56:01.507,0:56:03.004
Apollonius!

0:56:20.073,0:56:22.031
Consul! Consul!

0:56:22.161,0:56:23.531
Step back!

0:56:24.275,0:56:25.408
Wait.

0:56:27.460,0:56:28.495
Speak.

0:56:28.537,0:56:30.792
I have a friend among
the slave prisoners.

0:56:31.163,0:56:33.048
I ask you... to free him.

0:56:37.393,0:56:39.560
And who are you
to deserve such favor?

0:56:39.606,0:56:43.061
I'm Julia, daughter of
Gaius Julius Caesar.

0:56:43.080,0:56:45.419
- Your fellow consul.
- The consul's daughter?

0:56:46.807,0:56:48.839
Didn't you know,
that those who choose to fight...

0:56:48.859,0:56:52.178
...against Rome are Rome's enemies,
and will be crucified tomorrow?

0:56:52.402,0:56:54.853
Apollonius was my teacher
not an enemy of Rome!

0:56:55.176,0:56:57.572
Everything good and decent
I have ever learned...

0:56:57.592,0:56:59.650
...has been taught to me by him.

0:57:00.393,0:57:02.130
You must spare him!

0:57:02.900,0:57:04.235
For my sake!

0:57:09.528,0:57:11.460
Consider your wish granted.

0:57:12.501,0:57:13.915
Take her to the holding pens,

0:57:14.113,0:57:17.578
and release this slave Apollonius
into the custody of his lawful owners.

0:57:17.795,0:57:18.920
Yes, sir.

0:57:19.281,0:57:21.596
Thank you, Consul.

0:57:22.132,0:57:23.255
Thank you.

0:57:45.495,0:57:48.069
- Apollonius!
- It's Julia?

0:58:06.128,0:58:07.416
Apollonius...

0:58:09.135,0:58:11.091
...I've come to take you home!

0:58:14.109,0:58:15.931
I'm not coming with you.

0:58:19.113,0:58:20.607
I shall stay here.

0:58:22.557,0:58:24.439
They will crucify you!

0:58:29.082,0:58:31.156
You've grown into a fine woman.

0:58:31.969,0:58:33.167
Intelligent,

0:58:33.862,0:58:36.913
full of everything that makes
the Romans great.

0:58:38.472,0:58:41.247
I am not a Roman, Julia.

0:58:42.002,0:58:45.265
- I am a slave.
- You're not a slave any longer.

0:58:46.155,0:58:48.689
You're free!
I am freeing you know!

0:58:49.423,0:58:51.881
Freedom is not something
you can be given.

0:58:52.479,0:58:54.268
It's something you have to take.

0:58:57.710,0:59:01.782
If you have done it earlier,
you could have been free years ago.

0:59:02.850,0:59:04.737
I should have asked my father.

0:59:05.096,0:59:06.493
He would have granted it.

0:59:07.646,0:59:10.327
But I never thought
it would make a difference.

0:59:11.358,0:59:13.573
It felt as though you were free.

0:59:14.578,0:59:16.379
I thought you happy.

0:59:17.328,0:59:18.542
I was.

0:59:19.629,0:59:22.050
But isn't happiness I'm seeking out.

0:59:22.414,0:59:25.042
- Something else.
- What?

0:59:26.929,0:59:28.173
Dignity.

0:59:31.797,0:59:33.354
You've been good to me.

0:59:33.635,0:59:35.257
You've been my family.

0:59:36.428,0:59:38.599
But they are my family now.

0:59:41.398,0:59:43.313
We both know where we belong...

0:59:44.712,0:59:47.454
...and I belong in there, with them.

0:59:53.406,0:59:55.370
One day you'll understand...

0:59:55.751,0:59:57.231
...my dear Julia.

0:59:59.227,1:00:00.505
Goodbye.

1:00:38.306,1:00:39.607
Mother...

1:00:41.539,1:00:42.792
Rest.

1:00:46.730,1:00:48.424
Something happened to me there.

1:00:48.983,1:00:51.611
It's an affliction, no more no less.

1:00:51.945,1:00:55.073
Your grandfather suffered
the same spells and lived into old age.

1:00:55.093,1:00:56.406
I meant something else.

1:00:57.075,1:00:59.261
Thought it happened
when I was watching Pompey.

1:01:00.119,1:01:01.597
He's been a friend to me,

1:01:02.163,1:01:05.448
and we speak together easily...
like brothers.

1:01:06.561,1:01:08.495
Yet we couldn't be more different.

1:01:11.005,1:01:13.007
He's a great army leader.

1:01:13.424,1:01:16.875
His provinces make him the richest
and most powerful man in Rome.

1:01:17.970,1:01:22.495
Your father wanted you to be a statesman
and now you are a consul of Rome.

1:01:23.643,1:01:26.084
That would have been
beyond his dreams.

1:01:27.188,1:01:28.673
I need an army.

1:01:29.148,1:01:31.427
To turn yourself into a Pompey?

1:01:31.776,1:01:34.028
How would you pay and feed
such an army?

1:01:34.028,1:01:36.755
Your consulship
already cost a fortune.

1:01:36.864,1:01:39.489
Yes, I am consul and I am broke.

1:01:41.410,1:01:44.169
The attack today
was stronger than usual.

1:01:46.207,1:01:48.195
There was something else mother,

1:01:48.254,1:01:50.829
this attack was different
in other ways.

1:01:51.795,1:01:53.185
How?

1:01:55.216,1:01:56.724
I saw something.

1:01:59.553,1:02:01.477
I saw something at that moment.

1:02:02.765,1:02:04.497
Not just about myself...

1:02:07.019,1:02:09.362
...but about the whole humankind.

1:02:12.024,1:02:13.935
How we keep ourselves small.

1:02:17.404,1:02:20.199
And I realized
I have not been inspired.

1:02:22.284,1:02:25.496
And as I watched Pompey
I saw that he was not inspired,

1:02:25.788,1:02:27.789
and he would never be inspired.

1:02:29.166,1:02:32.044
And I realized the difference
between Pompey and me.

1:02:34.254,1:02:36.646
Pompey has merely done something...

1:02:38.634,1:02:40.800
...but I am for something.

1:02:41.553,1:02:43.602
And I need legions.

1:02:45.015,1:02:46.641
Pompey has them.

1:02:48.852,1:02:50.652
He will lend them to me.

1:02:51.229,1:02:54.571
Why would Pompey do that,
diminishing his own power?

1:02:56.026,1:03:00.153
What could you offer him in return
equal as the value of an army?

1:03:29.685,1:03:30.865
Julia...

1:03:34.354,1:03:36.423
...I'm sorry for
what happened to Apollonius.

1:03:38.578,1:03:40.973
I felt great affection
for him as well.

1:03:44.602,1:03:47.897
We trust in the wisdom
of our forefathers,

1:03:48.272,1:03:51.108
and in their laws.
And I, Cato, trust in him.

1:03:51.400,1:03:53.193
Hail Pompey!

1:03:53.485,1:03:55.417
Cato, you flatter me.

1:03:56.905,1:03:59.310
But let us give credit
to another man!

1:03:59.867,1:04:03.149
For I could not have fought
a war across the sea...

1:04:03.191,1:04:07.332
...without knowledge that Rome
was in safe hands here at home.

1:04:07.750,1:04:11.837
And for that we owe a debt of gratitude
to my friend and fellow consul,

1:04:12.129,1:04:15.606
Gaius Julius Caesar!

1:04:15.758,1:04:17.676
Hail, Caesar!

1:04:24.641,1:04:26.453
This is my daughter, Julia.

1:04:26.558,1:04:28.519
Yes I know, we've met.

1:04:31.106,1:04:33.937
It would honor my house
if you would give us a recitation.

1:04:35.193,1:04:37.006
Not in front of so many people.

1:04:37.048,1:04:38.973
You've done it in
larger groups than this.

1:04:39.072,1:04:41.950
Father, I assure you
that I'm not prepared for it.

1:04:44.036,1:04:46.100
Come. Come.

1:04:49.082,1:04:53.211
The daughter of Caesar
will recite for us!

1:05:03.180,1:05:04.598
Tonight,

1:05:04.973,1:05:07.601
stand beside me and praise with me...

1:05:08.226,1:05:10.821
...a man dear to me and to the gods.

1:05:11.146,1:05:14.901
Mightier in victory
than the kings of Mycenae,

1:05:15.358,1:05:17.777
with their golden haired horses.

1:05:18.111,1:05:21.656
And stronger far more
than the battle ghosts,

1:05:21.948,1:05:24.159
that ride the shores of Troy.

1:05:25.243,1:05:26.602
Hear me,

1:05:27.245,1:05:29.560
sons of gold headed men.

1:05:30.457,1:05:32.250
Hear me sing the victory...

1:05:32.542,1:05:36.273
...of a man dear to me
and to the gods.

1:06:31.660,1:06:33.939
- It's really nothing.
- No, it's not your fault.

1:06:33.978,1:06:36.716
I'm not sure whose fault it is
but I assure you I will find out,

1:06:36.736,1:06:38.719
and he will be punished severely.

1:06:40.651,1:06:42.945
Thank you, Consul, you're very kind.

1:06:43.738,1:06:46.198
- What's your name?
- Calpurnia.

1:06:46.782,1:06:49.384
- From which House?
- Lucius Piso.

1:06:51.036,1:06:53.247
I'm sorry for staring,
I thought perhaps we...

1:06:54.081,1:06:56.667
...met somewhere before.

1:06:58.461,1:07:01.645
- Would you like to eat together?
- I'd be delighted.

1:07:18.689,1:07:20.679
What hour do you call this?

1:07:23.569,1:07:25.728
I think it's known
as the fifth hour.

1:07:26.002,1:07:27.513
Yes, the sun is coming up.

1:07:28.782,1:07:32.055
You're right, I was out with him.

1:07:33.120,1:07:37.589
We drank and ate
and had entertainment.

1:07:38.959,1:07:41.972
- He cares for me.
- Oh, yes, he's twice your age.

1:07:43.797,1:07:46.216
And your friend, remember?

1:07:47.884,1:07:49.475
Yes, he is my friend.

1:07:51.430,1:07:55.392
I just want to know
if he treats you with respect.

1:08:04.484,1:08:07.362
I like him. I do.

1:08:08.905,1:08:11.283
I don't love him, not yet, but...

1:08:11.825,1:08:13.493
...that may come.

1:08:18.540,1:08:20.766
Why are you behaving
in such a manner?

1:08:21.627,1:08:23.321
He is consul.

1:08:23.627,1:08:25.744
He is the first man in Rome.

1:08:27.299,1:08:28.842
He has legions.

1:08:35.765,1:08:37.448
The price is high.

1:08:40.144,1:08:44.178
Price? It's customary for
the father to offer a dowry.

1:08:44.274,1:08:46.048
You know I have nothing to give you.

1:08:52.240,1:08:53.720
I accept.

1:08:54.575,1:08:55.910
I want a commission.

1:08:57.912,1:09:00.894
Gaul.
- Gaul? It's taken.

1:09:03.126,1:09:06.379
By Cassius.
- I need a victory in battle.

1:09:08.173,1:09:11.551
You're not experienced enough
in warfare and you need legions!

1:09:13.344,1:09:14.969
Your legions.

1:09:18.599,1:09:22.270
She's all I've got,
I want 50,000 for her.

1:09:24.564,1:09:25.926
Talents?

1:09:31.404,1:09:33.220
Soldiers.

1:10:08.941,1:10:10.442
How could you do it?

1:10:10.985,1:10:13.153
How could you take my commission away?

1:10:13.529,1:10:16.073
Because I think Caesar's
the right man for Gaul.

1:10:17.783,1:10:21.676
But I've already put myself to considerable
expense preparing my men.

1:10:21.995,1:10:24.428
- And you'll be reimbursed.
- What?

1:10:24.457,1:10:26.900
And I'll propose that you
look after the garrison.

1:10:27.126,1:10:30.212
- The garrison?
- This won't do, Pompey.

1:10:30.754,1:10:34.550
- You didn't put this before the Senate...
- Let's not talk business...

1:10:35.133,1:10:37.255
...at my wedding.

1:10:37.678,1:10:39.865
It may tempt bad luck.

1:10:54.069,1:10:56.180
I have a confession to make.

1:10:56.572,1:10:57.906
What's that?

1:10:59.449,1:11:02.741
We did meet before. Or rather...

1:11:04.162,1:11:07.582
...I met you,
but you didn't meet me.

1:11:08.416,1:11:10.605
It was at Pompey's triumph.

1:11:14.548,1:11:15.882
You fell.

1:11:18.385,1:11:21.287
Nobody saw it, but me.

1:11:21.680,1:11:24.289
I held you to make sure you didn't...

1:11:24.579,1:11:26.313
- ...hurt yourself.
- Thank you.

1:11:31.398,1:11:33.053
It shames me.

1:11:36.569,1:11:38.779
I never know when
it's going to happen.

1:11:40.615,1:11:43.743
Many people believe that
those who have the condition...

1:11:44.077,1:11:45.725
...are holy.

1:11:46.705,1:11:48.430
Blessed by the gods.

1:11:53.419,1:11:54.811
Perhaps.

1:12:21.572,1:12:23.798
What do you suppose
a child of both of our faces...

1:12:23.818,1:12:25.887
...blended together
would look like?

1:12:28.704,1:12:31.832
I think... it would look
rather beautiful.

1:12:33.709,1:12:35.079
Do you?

1:12:37.129,1:12:39.966
- Is it something you'd like to find out?
- Yes.

1:12:43.886,1:12:45.410
Are you sure?

1:12:48.725,1:12:52.520
I am less sure about my own name
than I am about this.

1:13:00.528,1:13:02.668
I am terrible around the house.

1:13:03.306,1:13:04.614
We have servants.

1:13:04.740,1:13:07.230
I'm not one for parties,
I go to bed early.

1:13:07.250,1:13:08.726
I'll follow you.

1:13:15.501,1:13:17.058
Caesar...

1:13:19.171,1:13:22.694
- ...you must make me a promise.
- Anything you like.

1:13:24.259,1:13:26.512
Come back from this war alive.

1:13:27.179,1:13:28.820
I promise you.

1:13:29.473,1:13:32.351
- And hurry.
- That's two promises.

1:13:33.477,1:13:37.292
- And win it.
- Now, that's three promises.

1:13:38.941,1:13:41.235
Now it is your turn
to promise me one thing.

1:13:43.737,1:13:46.386
Will you marry me before I leave?

1:14:00.774,1:14:04.442
BORDERS OF GAUL
58 B.C.

1:15:12.075,1:15:15.439
- How many dead?
- In the region of 23,000 Celts.

1:15:15.481,1:15:17.410
- And Romans?
- 112.

1:15:17.580,1:15:19.865
I've had to prepare
the burial back in Rome.

1:15:20.291,1:15:21.782
We're not returning to Rome.

1:15:22.637,1:15:23.887
We're going farther north.

1:15:24.796,1:15:26.714
There's a lot more of Rome out there.

1:15:27.215,1:15:29.158
Just isn't called Rome yet.

1:15:30.259,1:15:32.325
The Rome attacking!

1:15:41.979,1:15:44.273
We must tell Caesar to retreat.

1:15:46.609,1:15:50.521
What I gave to Caesar,
I will not revoke.

1:16:16.847,1:16:17.958
Wait!

1:16:18.685,1:16:20.051
Put down your blades.

1:16:29.443,1:16:31.092
Why have you come here?

1:16:31.570,1:16:33.980
This land is ours,
you have no right to be here!

1:16:35.783,1:16:37.316
What is your name?

1:16:37.993,1:16:39.578
Vercingetorix.

1:16:40.662,1:16:43.420
- You stayed to fight alone?
- This is my house.

1:16:43.707,1:16:47.154
I'll fill it with my own hands,
if you burn it down!

1:16:52.966,1:16:54.573
You're free to go.

1:17:02.559,1:17:04.039
Give me a horse.

1:17:06.605,1:17:07.921
You heard him.

1:17:09.149,1:17:10.642
Give him a horse.

1:17:43.308,1:17:44.726
My dear Caesar,

1:17:45.852,1:17:48.646
the people speak of you
with admiration.

1:17:49.064,1:17:52.720
Some call you "the Great"
as they called Pompey.

1:17:53.234,1:17:57.711
In the market, people sometimes
bow to me as I pass.

1:17:58.114,1:18:00.171
It will also delight you to know,

1:18:00.213,1:18:02.348
that the marriage that began
as an advantage,

1:18:02.373,1:18:04.752
has blossomed into romance.

1:18:05.747,1:18:09.000
Watching Julia and Pompey
together delights me,

1:18:09.292,1:18:11.614
and saddens me
that you're not here.

1:18:12.086,1:18:15.548
No one could be prouder
to be your wife, Caesar.

1:18:15.840,1:18:18.051
But after so long without you,

1:18:18.509,1:18:21.429
I fear I'm getting used
to my solitude.

1:18:21.804,1:18:24.182
Come home soon my darling.

1:18:24.640,1:18:27.518
Until then I will be waiting.

1:18:27.977,1:18:30.890
Caesar has killed 300,000 Celts!

1:18:31.147,1:18:35.985
He attacked peaceful villages,
villages who pay taxes to the Roman state!

1:18:36.277,1:18:37.721
It's beyond toleration!

1:18:37.736,1:18:40.968
This is how you thank
a great Roman general?

1:18:40.990,1:18:43.687
Caesar sent 100,000 slaves
back to Rome!

1:18:43.785,1:18:45.953
Are you saying you haven't
taken any of them?

1:18:45.953,1:18:47.314
Oh, if they hadn't come from him,

1:18:47.334,1:18:49.022
I would have got them
from somewhere else.

1:18:50.583,1:18:52.668
Pompey, you have to be weary.

1:18:52.835,1:18:55.880
He's been away three years
fighting with your legions.

1:18:56.172,1:18:58.257
He's doubled their salary.

1:18:58.633,1:19:00.952
They are totally devoted to him!

1:19:00.968,1:19:04.694
My lords, as Cicero
has put it so well:

1:19:05.973,1:19:09.092
Strain every nerve for
the preservation of the state,

1:19:09.435,1:19:12.563
look in every corner for the storms.

1:19:12.855,1:19:17.459
They will burst upon you
if you do not see them in time.

1:19:35.294,1:19:37.069
I just remembered who he is!

1:19:37.212,1:19:39.277
- What are you talking about?
- That man!

1:19:39.882,1:19:41.324
- Mark Antony?
- Yes!

1:19:41.925,1:19:45.508
Running from his debtors in Rome
to find wealth in the province...

1:19:46.096,1:19:47.890
- ...like all of us.
- Hey, not me!

1:19:48.432,1:19:50.726
I still fight for the glory of Rome!

1:20:32.745,1:20:34.895
- Our cavalry's been attacked.
- By who?

1:20:35.186,1:20:38.940
- Gallic tribesmen. 14,000 dead.
- 14,000?

1:20:39.274,1:20:42.110
And many more wounded.
They've united under one leader.

1:20:42.694,1:20:44.804
His name is Vercingetorix.

1:20:53.830,1:20:56.526
- Where could we find him?
- In Alesia.

1:20:56.750,1:20:59.165
- How long is the march?
- Eight days.

1:21:09.804,1:21:12.726
Vercingetorix is in there
with 18,000 of his men.

1:21:13.683,1:21:16.158
It's the most invincible
stronghold in Gaul.

1:21:16.894,1:21:19.881
- We'll never break it.
- Well, we won't have to break it.

1:21:20.106,1:21:22.442
We'll build a wall
around their city.

1:21:22.651,1:21:25.140
We'll trap them inside
and starve them.

1:21:25.737,1:21:28.472
Nobody's ever built
a fortification of that length.

1:21:30.241,1:21:32.145
Then we will be the first.

1:21:34.954,1:21:36.814
Let's not waste time.

1:21:42.295,1:21:44.244
What do you mean?

1:21:46.090,1:21:48.467
- I'm here to see Pompey.
- This way.

1:21:51.201,1:21:55.874
POMPEY'S MANOR
Pisa

1:22:02.565,1:22:05.109
- Cato!
- Pompey.

1:22:06.402,1:22:07.903
Julia!

1:22:09.280,1:22:10.937
What brings you to Pisa?

1:22:12.366,1:22:14.070
I've come to speak with you.

1:22:16.078,1:22:19.832
Your absence in Rome
has been... criticized.

1:22:20.750,1:22:24.368
As you can see,
my wife needs me here.

1:22:27.339,1:22:29.163
Could we speak privately?

1:22:29.967,1:22:31.504
What's the matter, Cato?

1:22:31.785,1:22:34.658
Did your conversation
depend on speaking ill of my father?

1:22:35.764,1:22:37.358
Sit, sit, Cato.

1:22:38.350,1:22:39.508
Thank you.

1:22:39.528,1:22:42.614
Caesar is about to take
the last stronghold in Gaul,

1:22:42.813,1:22:47.759
Vercingetorix has called forth every tribe
from the mountains to the sea!

1:22:48.652,1:22:50.988
They are on the move to Alesia!

1:22:51.488,1:22:52.915
How many men?

1:22:53.866,1:22:55.972
Two hundred and fifty thousand!

1:22:58.912,1:23:01.574
- And my husband?
- Forty thousand.

1:23:07.254,1:23:10.994
He... He will survive. He has survived
these many years.

1:23:11.091,1:23:13.635
He's never been up against so much.

1:23:16.221,1:23:17.279
Is this true?

1:23:18.092,1:23:19.915
Will my husband lose this time?

1:23:19.957,1:23:22.294
No one knows the outcome of war.

1:23:22.853,1:23:25.846
You are consul.
Pompey, do something.

1:23:28.275,1:23:30.210
If Caesar wins this battle...

1:23:30.764,1:23:32.636
He will become the next Sulla.

1:23:32.863,1:23:34.898
That's what you were going
to say, wasn't it?

1:23:35.073,1:23:37.970
That if he wins he will
become the next Sulla.

1:23:40.120,1:23:41.866
Why are you worried, Cato?

1:23:42.789,1:23:45.485
You said he doesn't stand a chance
against the Gauls.

1:23:46.334,1:23:47.711
Why call him back?

1:23:48.503,1:23:51.840
Why not just leave him there to fight
this battle to his own death?

1:23:53.717,1:23:57.484
If you leave him there, your next Sulla
will extinguish himself.

1:24:00.306,1:24:03.795
You're waiting for my husband
to fail, aren't you?

1:24:09.941,1:24:11.640
And so are you.

1:24:24.741,1:24:26.389
My dear Calpurnia,

1:24:27.467,1:24:31.361
I'm doing everything in my power
to make sure I come home safely to you.

1:24:32.438,1:24:36.115
You must have heard we've built a wall
to hold the Alessians in.

1:24:37.261,1:24:40.706
What you may not know is that
we've built a second wall as well...

1:24:41.244,1:24:43.258
...to keep their allies out.

1:24:43.884,1:24:45.668
I say this to reassure you...

1:24:46.470,1:24:50.165
...they can round up ten times our number
and still we will defeat them,

1:24:50.382,1:24:54.642
because it's not numbers
but vision that wins wars.

1:24:56.391,1:24:59.111
My vision is of
returning to you, my love.

1:24:59.890,1:25:03.689
And not just returning,
but returning victorious...

1:25:04.486,1:25:06.337
...as I've promised you.

1:25:09.578,1:25:13.478
When my men are tired,
I can't always let them rest.

1:25:14.285,1:25:17.000
When they're hungry,
I can't always feed them.

1:25:18.414,1:25:20.202
But when they forget their vision,

1:25:20.954,1:25:22.657
I can share mine with them.

1:25:23.996,1:25:25.667
And the more that I share...

1:25:26.879,1:25:28.561
...more of it I have.

1:25:31.171,1:25:33.557
It will take 30 days
to round up the tribes.

1:25:33.683,1:25:35.178
How much food have we got?

1:25:36.519,1:25:38.595
27 days of grain.

1:25:39.092,1:25:41.306
Then we'll make them last 35.

1:25:41.851,1:25:43.605
We will divide rations...

1:25:45.351,1:25:47.401
...of all the grain
brought to the stores.

1:25:47.485,1:25:50.611
With the penalty of death,
no one will eat beyond their measure.

1:25:52.569,1:25:55.320
The tribesmen come from
the countryside to fight with us.

1:25:56.256,1:25:59.408
The Gauls will outnumber
the Romans five to one.

1:25:59.991,1:26:01.531
If we succeed...

1:26:02.740,1:26:05.371
...we could destroy the Roman
presence in Gaul forever.

1:26:06.083,1:26:09.166
If we fail... we'll be their slaves.

1:26:14.550,1:26:16.513
In the evening we take our leisure.

1:26:16.889,1:26:20.215
Tell stories about the city
and our families,

1:26:21.105,1:26:24.195
or just eat in silence
after our hard day's work.

1:26:25.446,1:26:27.028
The men do work hard,

1:26:27.612,1:26:30.358
but, there are worse things
than hard labor.

1:26:31.184,1:26:33.366
Waiting is much worse.

1:26:34.198,1:26:37.563
Waiting is the hardest
part of war, my dear wife.

1:26:38.913,1:26:41.499
Most of our men would welcome
the cry of battle...

1:26:41.872,1:26:43.876
...over this dreaded silence.

1:26:44.702,1:26:47.391
They would fight an enemy
we could see however great...

1:26:47.752,1:26:51.254
...sooner than fight the one in our minds
which goes on killing forever.

1:26:52.973,1:26:54.835
The real enemy is almost a comfort...

1:26:55.002,1:26:57.549
...I sometimes think
as I look up the hill to Alesia.

1:26:58.187,1:27:00.899
They're just like us,
they have courage like us,

1:27:01.399,1:27:03.561
they're dying like us.

1:27:09.189,1:27:11.068
The tribe should have been
here by now.

1:27:12.771,1:27:14.111
If they don't come...

1:27:15.359,1:27:17.032
...we'll have to fight on our own.

1:27:17.822,1:27:19.280
We don't have enough men.

1:27:19.992,1:27:21.279
I say...

1:27:22.072,1:27:25.117
- ...we give ourselves up.
- And be Roman slaves?

1:27:25.205,1:27:28.037
If we die... our gods die.

1:27:28.798,1:27:29.959
At least if we live...

1:27:30.001,1:27:32.537
- In slavery?
- In any state.

1:27:33.598,1:27:36.805
If we live, we can perform
that service to the gods.

1:27:37.433,1:27:39.243
We can keep them living
for our children.

1:27:39.263,1:27:41.442
You think the gods would want us
to keep them alive...

1:27:41.473,1:27:43.389
...so they can be
worshipped by slaves?

1:27:44.139,1:27:46.953
If we have nothing
left to feed ourselves with,

1:27:48.519,1:27:51.356
I say we... do what our
ancestors did:

1:27:52.947,1:27:56.750
We eat the elderly and the infirm...

1:27:56.792,1:27:58.663
...to keep ourselves alive.

1:28:05.108,1:28:07.124
We won't eat our own people.

1:28:09.582,1:28:12.128
There's enough food left
for several days...

1:28:17.428,1:28:19.593
...if we only feed our men.

1:28:24.008,1:28:26.774
There's a way we can
compromise the Romans.

1:28:27.176,1:28:28.767
To weaken them.

1:28:36.109,1:28:37.359
They say...

1:28:38.960,1:28:41.491
...we give up our women
and children to them.

1:28:45.782,1:28:48.807
Our rations will keep us alive
for several more days.

1:28:50.840,1:28:53.758
If our women and children
become their slaves...

1:28:54.457,1:28:56.518
...the Romans
will have to feed them...

1:28:56.543,1:28:58.658
...and that will deplete
their supplies.

1:29:00.513,1:29:03.385
We must bid farewell
to our families.

1:29:04.365,1:29:05.842
We must do it today...

1:29:07.997,1:29:12.485
...and whatever happens you must
lock the gates behind them forever.

1:29:14.748,1:29:16.570
Our survival depends upon it.

1:29:19.950,1:29:23.199
This will be our sacrifice
to the gods.

1:31:23.626,1:31:25.541
Open the doors!

1:31:25.976,1:31:27.456
Please, help!

1:31:30.949,1:31:32.738
Open the doors!

1:31:39.704,1:31:41.621
Open the gates!

1:31:48.378,1:31:50.348
Send men down to the gates.

1:31:53.024,1:31:54.840
Bolt the gates...

1:31:56.813,1:31:58.604
...and double the guard.

1:32:10.591,1:32:12.078
Caesar,

1:32:14.478,1:32:16.584
I beg you to reconsider.

1:32:18.831,1:32:20.175
They'll all die.

1:32:25.096,1:32:27.120
I will not stare my own men...

1:32:27.215,1:32:28.996
...to keep the enemy alive.

1:32:33.967,1:32:35.764
Send them back to Alesia.

1:32:44.521,1:32:45.858
Go back!

1:32:46.241,1:32:47.481
Go!

1:33:02.448,1:33:04.626
Open the gates!

1:34:04.675,1:34:07.146
- What is this?
- A soup.

1:34:10.366,1:34:11.606
This is not soup.

1:34:12.452,1:34:13.866
This is water!

1:34:13.890,1:34:16.863
We fight for years,
and they give us water!

1:34:16.883,1:34:19.699
We die for Rome, and we get water?

1:34:26.423,1:34:28.422
Stop! Now!

1:34:33.740,1:34:36.761
What is the difference between
the Romans and the Gauls?

1:34:39.423,1:34:40.588
Discipline!

1:34:41.643,1:34:43.811
We act as one body!

1:34:45.732,1:34:47.273
That's what makes us strong!

1:34:52.946,1:34:56.332
You think I eat well...
while you starve?

1:34:59.416,1:35:01.324
I eat the same portions as you...

1:35:02.667,1:35:04.391
...and I am hungry.

1:35:07.452,1:35:11.996
But I would eat soil, before I give up
what we've come here to get!

1:35:15.758,1:35:18.469
And that is everything...

1:35:19.724,1:35:21.054
...you see!

1:35:22.221,1:35:23.350
You!

1:35:25.326,1:35:27.396
Will you raise your family...

1:35:28.977,1:35:30.565
...on that hillside?

1:35:32.620,1:35:34.648
Would that be a plot of land?

1:35:36.149,1:35:37.363
You!

1:35:39.916,1:35:41.543
That field there...

1:35:42.114,1:35:43.361
...between those trees...

1:35:44.587,1:35:46.143
...that's yours if you want it.

1:35:47.259,1:35:49.248
It's rich soil, good for growing.

1:35:51.525,1:35:52.718
All of you...

1:35:53.799,1:35:57.214
...each and every one of you
will get his share!

1:35:59.212,1:36:00.928
You have worked for it.

1:36:01.186,1:36:05.594
By the gods, we've given our souls
to this place for eight years!

1:36:08.755,1:36:11.227
Let's not abandon
before we get them back!

1:36:14.689,1:36:16.254
Open the gates!

1:36:24.371,1:36:26.360
I told you before, and I tell you again,

1:36:26.402,1:36:28.283
is the worst Caesar's crime!

1:36:28.303,1:36:30.240
He's away in war on behalf of Rome!

1:36:30.260,1:36:33.298
- We commissioned him to fight the Gauls!
- Not all of them!

1:36:33.884,1:36:36.870
He started fighting the insurgents
at the borders and moved on...

1:36:36.886,1:36:37.919
...to murder...

1:36:38.184,1:36:40.149
...peaceful Roman allies, Gauls,

1:36:40.477,1:36:44.257
who pay taxes and tribute to Rome.
I fear the gods gentlemen!

1:36:44.645,1:36:47.222
Caesar is not Sulla,
he's not fighting the Romans,

1:36:47.242,1:36:48.727
he's fighting the Gauls!

1:36:48.757,1:36:51.474
He's not threatening us,
we are threatening him!

1:36:51.494,1:36:54.574
Once Caesar was consul, how many times
did he push through a law...

1:36:54.594,1:36:56.576
...without having it ratified?

1:36:56.615,1:36:59.026
He has no respect for us!

1:36:59.781,1:37:02.161
Something had better be done...

1:37:02.733,1:37:04.112
...and right away!

1:37:05.161,1:37:07.205
I propose we do nothing at all.

1:37:08.585,1:37:09.923
Cassius.

1:37:10.534,1:37:13.719
You say all of Gaul
is rallying against him?

1:37:15.502,1:37:19.846
He can't possibly win...
against such numbers.

1:38:00.660,1:38:01.998
To arms!

1:38:10.041,1:38:11.124
This is it.

1:38:32.209,1:38:33.492
Motion at the gate!

1:39:03.931,1:39:06.051
He's trying to fool us
into gathering our troops here.

1:39:11.050,1:39:13.150
How do you know what he'll do?

1:39:14.708,1:39:16.033
Because it's what I would do.

1:39:24.641,1:39:27.426
I will wait here for
Vercingetorix to make his move.

1:39:27.828,1:39:30.011
His men are too weak
to attack our main camp.

1:39:30.206,1:39:33.806
He will move his cavalry here and try
to break through the inner wall...

1:39:33.930,1:39:36.273
...while his allies attack
from the outside.

1:39:37.165,1:39:40.231
We cannot let these
two forces join together.

1:39:41.467,1:39:43.750
If they do, we will not survive.

1:40:12.640,1:40:14.018
Prepare to fire!

1:40:16.267,1:40:17.533
Fire!

1:40:37.544,1:40:39.108
Forward!

1:43:23.082,1:43:24.505
We must hold on!

1:44:09.327,1:44:10.448
Go!

1:44:56.490,1:44:58.009
Retreat!

1:45:22.916,1:45:25.744
Try one! Try the other!

1:45:48.765,1:45:50.595
Caesar, your men are asking for you.

1:46:15.444,1:46:19.948
It is with great sadness that I write
this letter to you, my dear husband.

1:46:20.907,1:46:26.121
Your Julia gave birth early and
she suffered some pain in doing so.

1:46:27.122,1:46:31.193
The doctors were there and did
what they could to ease her suffering.

1:46:31.835,1:46:36.715
The child was a boy, but frail,
their efforts could not save him.

1:46:37.090,1:46:41.855
He looked like you, Caesar,
there was nobility in his face.

1:46:42.595,1:46:45.782
Your daughter struggled
to sustain this tragic birth,

1:46:46.141,1:46:48.828
but in the end she could not.

1:46:52.689,1:46:55.477
Pompey has kept himself
from the Senate,

1:46:55.791,1:46:59.318
preferring instead
to pass time in no company.

1:46:59.487,1:47:02.991
He walks around the graveyard
again and again,

1:47:03.324,1:47:05.915
keeping fresh garlands on her tomb.

1:47:29.475,1:47:31.700
We take Alesia in the morning.

1:49:05.070,1:49:06.196
Open the gate!

1:50:23.564,1:50:28.152
I know your only real enemy is one man
and he is standing before you now.

1:50:31.239,1:50:33.574
I'm giving myself to you, Caesar.

1:50:42.875,1:50:45.009
Our women died for us.

1:50:46.671,1:50:51.133
I give you my own life
so that you may let my men live.

1:51:06.399,1:51:10.277
If my men die, there will be
nothing left of the Gauls,

1:51:10.360,1:51:13.005
no one left
to worship our gods.

1:51:15.116,1:51:16.490
I beg you.

1:51:19.536,1:51:22.431
Enslave my people if you need to,

1:51:23.332,1:51:24.762
but let them live.

1:51:52.319,1:51:53.795
Your men will live.

1:52:03.539,1:52:05.133
My dear wife,

1:52:05.666,1:52:09.355
we will have to wait a bit more
before we're together again.

1:52:10.504,1:52:14.341
You see there are those in Rome
who would have me branded an outlaw.

1:52:14.633,1:52:18.285
So I have sent Mark Antony to talk
to the Senate on my behalf.

1:52:18.345,1:52:21.573
Since there has never been a soldier
with an army such as mine...

1:52:21.598,1:52:24.643
...who returned to Rome
without taking her by force,

1:52:24.935,1:52:29.105
I too must be planning such an assault,
but my crime is worse.

1:52:29.397,1:52:33.251
Because I return not
in dishonor, but in triumph.

1:52:33.401,1:52:35.570
And this the Senate cannot tolerate.

1:52:35.972,1:52:39.324
How long ago did Sulla
ride in the town with his army,

1:52:39.616,1:52:43.787
breaking the sacred
Roman law stating that no man...

1:52:43.912,1:52:47.058
...must bring armed men
past the Rubicon into Rome?

1:52:47.707,1:52:52.921
How fresh in your memory does bloodshed
have to be, for you to show caution?

1:52:53.130,1:52:56.110
Caesar has done more for Rome
than any other general in its history.

1:52:56.615,1:52:57.948
How do you respond?

1:52:58.093,1:53:01.028
You strip him of his consulship,
in his absence, without explanation.

1:53:01.048,1:53:03.581
He's more than doubled the size of Rome
in the last eight years...

1:53:03.601,1:53:05.071
...and what do you ask him to do?

1:53:05.391,1:53:07.341
Lay down his arms.

1:53:08.770,1:53:11.268
It is not Caesar,
who is the criminal.

1:53:12.941,1:53:14.634
It is this Senate!

1:53:17.654,1:53:20.156
This Senate represents
the people of Rome.

1:53:20.448,1:53:23.388
This Senate represents
its own interests.

1:53:25.912,1:53:28.614
Sulla said almost the very same thing.

1:53:29.123,1:53:31.057
If he said it, he was right.

1:53:32.085,1:53:34.802
But the difference between
Sulla and Caesar is:

1:53:35.129,1:53:38.875
The people feared Sulla,
Caesar they love.

1:53:41.010,1:53:42.529
You know nothing...

1:53:43.930,1:53:45.901
...of the people's feelings.

1:53:50.436,1:53:51.956
You're right, I don't.

1:53:53.272,1:53:54.828
Let me ask them.

1:54:07.453,1:54:11.332
People of Rome, I come to you
with questions from Caesar!

1:54:11.665,1:54:16.045
He needs to know what you want
so he can better serve your needs.

1:54:17.004,1:54:19.652
The Senate says
they represent the people,

1:54:19.694,1:54:24.303
but the Senate wants Caesar to lay down
his arms, and return to Rome as a man,

1:54:24.595,1:54:29.475
not as a soldier.
And when he arrives, the Senate...

1:54:29.767,1:54:32.713
...will find him guilty
of crimes against the state.

1:54:33.562,1:54:38.670
Caesar's crime is spending
eight years in battle, outside of Rome,

1:54:38.984,1:54:41.262
with none of the comforts 
we all take for granted...

1:54:41.282,1:54:43.548
...and with a daily threat
to his life. Why?

1:54:44.115,1:54:47.386
So he can bring wealth
to the Roman people.

1:54:48.452,1:54:51.588
Temples, libraries,
holidays and games...

1:54:51.608,1:54:53.782
...are all funded
by Cesar's levies in Gaul,

1:54:53.802,1:54:56.348
yet what do they think in the Senate?

1:54:56.752,1:55:00.661
They think he's doing this
for personal gain. I ask you:

1:55:01.798,1:55:04.187
If he's doing this for private gain,

1:55:05.489,1:55:07.110
why does he stay in Gaul?

1:55:07.638,1:55:09.914
Why does he live in a tent?

1:55:12.684,1:55:14.473
I know why he does it.

1:55:15.520,1:55:20.333
He does it so we Romans
can live well.

1:55:20.776,1:55:22.424
What are you going to do about this?

1:55:22.444,1:55:24.185
Whatever these men may think,

1:55:24.738,1:55:27.387
some of whom have never been
up on a horse's back,

1:55:29.724,1:55:34.623
I have never known a man
tougher on the enemies of Rome,

1:55:34.915,1:55:37.272
nor gentler to its friends.

1:55:37.876,1:55:40.404
When I call myself a Roman,

1:55:41.463,1:55:44.007
the thing that makes me most proud,

1:55:44.299,1:55:46.905
is to share that title
with one other man!

1:55:47.302,1:55:50.792
A man whom it has been
my privilege to fight beside,

1:55:51.223,1:55:53.767
a man who has shown
time and again...

1:55:53.787,1:55:57.253
...that he loves his own life
less than he loves yours!

1:55:58.563,1:56:03.890
His name is Gaius Julius Caesar!

1:56:08.454,1:56:09.945
Caesar!

1:56:15.645,1:56:16.983
Caesar!

1:56:22.272,1:56:34.214
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

1:56:34.891,1:56:37.120
We must do something, Pompey.

1:56:37.575,1:56:40.537
Caesar could march
on Rome at any time.

1:56:41.189,1:56:43.533
I'm not going to wait for him
to come to us.

1:56:44.381,1:56:45.750
I'll gather our troops...

1:56:46.402,1:56:48.762
...and attack him before
he sets foot in Rome.

1:56:50.073,1:56:53.688
I'm going to wipe him and his legions
off the face of the earth.

1:56:53.887,1:57:02.018
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

1:57:07.340,1:57:10.009
Men, we have two choices:

1:57:11.635,1:57:16.599
We can be slaughtered by the army
Pompey is amassing against us,

1:57:18.142,1:57:20.227
or we can fight for our lives,

1:57:20.436,1:57:24.003
just as we've done
every day for eight years!

1:57:26.817,1:57:28.797
I've made my decision!

1:57:30.863,1:57:32.717
I'm going to Rome!

1:57:34.116,1:57:36.744
I'm going to cross the Rubicon!

1:57:39.330,1:57:41.165
Will anyone be coming with me?

1:57:41.564,1:57:43.822
Yeah!

1:57:51.676,1:57:55.114
To Rome! Let the dice fly!

1:57:56.096,1:57:59.585
My legions from Spain should
sail to Ostia from the West.

1:57:59.934,1:58:02.496
The Thracians will come to us
from the North,

1:58:02.870,1:58:05.607
and from the East the Macedonians.

1:58:05.689,1:58:07.507
Caesar is on his way to Rome!

1:58:08.734,1:58:11.316
- How far is he?
- Four days from here.

1:58:11.737,1:58:13.132
That's impossible!

1:58:13.328,1:58:15.166
I heard it from Bibulus himself.

1:58:15.532,1:58:17.426
Caesar has passed the Rubicon.

1:58:22.331,1:58:25.905
We must leave Rome.
We cannot defend it without troops.

1:58:29.004,1:58:30.274
We'll go to Greece.

1:58:30.547,1:58:35.436
We amass what strength we can,
and then we take him in Rome itself.

1:58:35.635,1:58:38.305
I only hope we don't
arrive too late...

1:58:38.472,1:58:41.359
...and find the bodies of
our friends on the Senate steps!

1:59:08.118,1:59:34.088
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

2:00:10.250,2:00:12.803
It has been decreed
by the new Senate...

2:00:13.211,2:00:19.343
...that the title of dictator
is bestowed upon Gaius Julius Caesar.

2:00:21.886,2:00:23.799
It has been decreed...

2:00:24.764,2:00:27.892
...there will be fifty days
of thanksgiving in his honor.

2:00:28.559,2:00:32.356
He is given the courts
and elected consul for life.

2:00:32.604,2:00:34.024
Hail, Caesar!

2:00:42.281,2:00:44.158
You treat me as a king,

2:00:45.870,2:00:49.516
though I assure that is
one role I shall never adopt.

2:00:50.790,2:00:53.440
I am Caesar, and only Caesar.

2:00:54.877,2:00:58.941
Is for this crown alone
that I conquered Gaul.

2:01:09.100,2:01:10.893
Caesar!

2:01:12.353,2:01:14.193
Caesar!

2:01:15.898,2:01:19.279
Beware the Ides of March!

2:01:20.694,2:01:22.914
The Ides of March...

2:01:23.072,2:01:24.824
...beware!

2:02:22.923,2:02:26.802
The men and women of Rome
are crying out for your head.

2:02:30.514,2:02:32.650
For a moment,
I saw them as you do.

2:02:32.692,2:02:35.330
You don't know how I see them.

2:02:35.644,2:02:37.975
I was disgusted with them.

2:02:41.608,2:02:44.401
How do you keep your purpose
clear in your mind?

2:02:45.445,2:02:47.607
When I met you in
your village, I could see...

2:02:48.077,2:02:50.163
...that you had your purpose
clear in your mind,

2:02:50.442,2:02:51.743
and it was pure.

2:02:53.703,2:02:55.830
I can see that it hasn't changed.

2:02:59.167,2:03:01.212
What did you do to preserve it?

2:03:04.756,2:03:06.007
You want to know?

2:03:07.008,2:03:08.259
Yes.

2:03:12.055,2:03:14.349
I only fight my enemies.

2:03:17.852,2:03:20.197
You think we are similar, don't you?

2:03:21.439,2:03:24.028
That's why it pains you
to see me die.

2:03:26.361,2:03:28.952
But we are very different, you and me.

2:03:29.405,2:03:31.285
I know when it's over.

2:03:31.658,2:03:33.950
Or when what's left
isn't worth having.

2:03:40.625,2:03:42.664
Give me the honor of dying alone...

2:03:43.722,2:03:45.255
...by my own hand,

2:03:46.089,2:03:49.937
instead of in a public spectacle
for your Roman mob.

2:03:53.304,2:03:57.439
I have to do what the people want,
I have no choice.

2:03:58.601,2:04:02.566
I thought power gave you
more choice, not less.

2:04:05.066,2:04:07.251
Listen to them! Do you hear that?

2:04:14.121,2:04:16.129
I don't hear anything
anymore but the voices...

2:04:16.140,2:04:19.076
...of our women and
our children in Alesia.

2:04:24.723,2:04:26.838
I can hear them when I'm asleep...

2:04:28.637,2:04:31.258
...and I hear them when I'm awake.

2:04:37.845,2:04:42.141
For pity's sake, give me a sword.

2:06:43.257,2:06:44.661
Hail, Caesar!

2:06:45.202,2:06:46.343
Hail, Caesar!

2:06:46.691,2:06:47.980
The ranks here...

2:06:49.029,2:06:51.565
- ...are depleted.
- My men will be joining you.

2:06:55.812,2:06:58.481
How shall we explain to the people...

2:06:58.773,2:07:01.192
...that these men
have become senators?

2:07:02.026,2:07:03.654
They haven't been selected...

2:07:03.670,2:07:06.037
- ...by the traditional legal...
- The law is changed!

2:07:07.406,2:07:11.295
And keep in mind,
the people trust my judgment.

2:07:12.620,2:07:15.595
And you will be joined
by my finest men.

2:07:16.707,2:07:19.347
I've spent eight years
with them in Gaul.

2:07:21.295,2:07:23.889
I must leave for Greece
to fight Pompey.

2:07:27.134,2:07:29.760
I'm leaving Rome in
Mark Antony's capable charge.

2:07:29.780,2:07:31.778
Do we have no say in this?

2:07:32.024,2:07:34.549
I don't want to distract you
with bureaucracy.

2:07:34.934,2:07:37.909
I'd rather leave you free
to argue matters of the state!

2:07:46.387,2:07:48.333
Do you think there will be black lists?

2:07:49.281,2:07:51.511
There won't be any lists.

2:07:51.742,2:07:54.927
Sulla killed his enemies,
I forgive mine.

2:07:56.246,2:07:58.293
Good day to you, gentlemen.

2:08:26.318,2:08:28.567
They left in a hurry.

2:09:07.451,2:09:09.582
Attend the Caesar!

2:09:30.256,2:09:33.927
I did not cross the Rubicon
to kill old friends.

2:09:34.761,2:09:37.889
I did it to protect myself
against my enemies.

2:09:38.765,2:09:43.561
I'm hoping we can secure ourselves
through mercy and not through vengefulness.

2:09:46.439,2:09:48.024
You're all free to go.

2:09:48.963,2:09:52.043
We owe all our lives to Caesar.

2:09:53.196,2:09:56.175
Did you say something,
my old friend?

2:09:57.033,2:09:59.263
I thought I heard you speak.

2:10:02.872,2:10:05.562
I'm grateful for your clemency.

2:10:07.335,2:10:09.693
Brutus, come dine with me.

2:10:19.931,2:10:21.205
Caesar...

2:10:22.083,2:10:23.653
...make peace with Pompey.

2:10:24.477,2:10:27.958
Now, for years, his only hope
was that one day,

2:10:27.980,2:10:30.794
you would rule Rome,
together again...

2:10:31.382,2:10:33.266
- ...with...
- With what?

2:10:35.696,2:10:38.867
With Julia, uniting you both.

2:10:40.576,2:10:43.473
Yes, he tolerated me,
because he loved Julia so much.

2:10:44.006,2:10:47.642
Caesar, he loved Julia
because he saw you in her.

2:10:48.959,2:10:53.297
He told me that... Julia's death
was almost unbearable.

2:10:53.964,2:10:58.552
And add to that the end of your friendship,
he counted his life as finished.

2:10:59.094,2:11:02.315
I'll make peace with him
if peace is what he wants.

2:11:04.933,2:11:08.124
I want to establish
some sanity in Rome.

2:11:08.854,2:11:11.494
The people have had
enough of fighting.

2:11:13.275,2:11:15.256
Will you help me?

2:11:16.331,2:11:17.503
How can I help you?

2:11:17.523,2:11:20.430
I want you to go back to Rome
and be my Praetor.

2:11:23.563,2:11:26.655
If peace is what you want,

2:11:27.873,2:11:30.356
then it'll be my honor to serve you.

2:11:35.964,2:11:38.314
Pompey has gone to Egypt.

2:11:39.979,2:11:42.575
The king died, leaving throne
to be squabbled over...

2:11:42.590,2:11:44.997
...by a twelve-year-old boy
and an eighteen-year-old girl.

2:11:45.188,2:11:46.705
Ptolemy and Cleopatra?

2:11:46.725,2:11:48.479
I don't know which one I trust less.

2:11:50.645,2:11:52.535
Help me ready the ships.

2:11:53.620,2:11:55.423
I'll follow him in the morning.

2:11:56.109,2:11:59.015
You don't need to take
troops with you.

2:12:00.155,2:12:04.012
Pompey has gone to Egypt alone.
The troops went to Utica.

2:12:04.262,2:12:06.786
- With your uncle Cato?
- Yes.

2:12:19.257,2:12:21.326
Trust me, Brutus,

2:12:22.302,2:12:25.722
whoever wants peace, will have it.

2:12:28.900,2:12:33.012
ALEXANDRIA
Egypt

2:13:43.234,2:13:47.652
He was most cruelly murdered
on the palace steps by his own men, sir.

2:13:49.221,2:13:52.433
It has been rumored that they were
bribed by Pothinus.

2:13:52.725,2:13:54.485
By Caesar.

2:13:59.064,2:14:01.191
There's only one enemy left.

2:14:29.108,2:14:33.441
I am Pothinus,
chief of the ruling council.

2:14:33.483,2:14:38.106
In the name of king Ptolemy,
I welcome you, Caesar.

2:14:38.623,2:14:40.230
Your king is very generous,

2:14:40.917,2:14:44.338
but as you can see,
we haven't brought any horses.

2:14:45.235,2:14:48.395
This grain is for your men, sir.

2:14:48.519,2:14:50.991
My men will eat indoors, Pothinus.

2:14:51.283,2:14:55.279
I'm sure you'll put us up
very comfortably... in your palace.

2:14:55.532,2:14:57.636
I'll tell you the truth, Caesar.

2:14:58.707,2:15:01.496
Ptolemy fears for his life.

2:15:01.585,2:15:04.336
There's been a great deal
of discord in Egypt,

2:15:04.588,2:15:07.667
so he has forbidden all visitors.

2:15:07.961,2:15:10.297
You, of course,

2:15:11.136,2:15:13.218
are very welcome in the palace.

2:15:14.347,2:15:15.831
And my men?

2:15:16.891,2:15:18.539
And your men.

2:15:20.020,2:15:21.261
Pothinus,

2:15:21.725,2:15:23.517
you wouldn't have
anything to do with...

2:15:24.349,2:15:26.394
...helping the king make his decisions?

2:15:27.477,2:15:31.106
- Would you?
- The king is a boy, sir.

2:15:31.568,2:15:34.033
Forgive him, and forgive me.

2:15:34.543,2:15:38.436
We are your allies and
your servants, great Caesar.

2:15:38.621,2:15:41.990
We only have the interests
of Rome in our hearts.

2:15:43.793,2:15:45.746
Bring out the gift.

2:16:01.602,2:16:03.826
This is Pompey's ring!

2:16:05.602,2:16:06.723
Where is he?

2:16:48.142,2:16:50.017
We thought...

2:16:50.976,2:16:52.190
...you'd be pleased.

2:17:18.554,2:17:20.055
Excuse me, Caesar.

2:17:20.540,2:17:23.543
There's a servant with an urgent
message from Cleopatra.

2:17:24.393,2:17:25.877
Bring her!

2:17:39.366,2:17:43.530
If you want to hear the message
you'll have to dismiss your guard.

2:17:49.834,2:17:53.279
What word from Cleopatra is
of such importance?

2:17:54.130,2:17:56.882
Cleopatra asks for your protection.

2:17:57.174,2:17:58.550
Protection, why?

2:17:59.302,2:18:02.931
Pothinus plans to kill her,
as he did Pompey.

2:18:10.355,2:18:13.672
Is that why you are disguised
as your own servant...

2:18:14.526,2:18:16.060
...Cleopatra?

2:18:26.788,2:18:28.866
I came to you, Caesar,

2:18:29.206,2:18:31.658
because you are
the only man I can trust.

2:18:35.046,2:18:37.142
Why does Pothinus want to kill you?

2:18:37.367,2:18:41.918
My father wanted me to rule Egypt,
he wrote it in his will.

2:18:42.804,2:18:45.899
But Pothinus banished me
with a price on my head.

2:18:46.975,2:18:51.684
Now any servant can kill me
and be rewarded for it.

2:18:59.070,2:19:00.604
Caesar...

2:19:03.156,2:19:05.117
...you and I, are alike.

2:19:06.076,2:19:10.855
You are the son of Venus,
and I am the daughter of Isis.

2:19:11.958,2:19:16.202
You and I, live by the same divine...

2:19:16.575,2:19:17.844
...heartbeat.

2:19:19.005,2:19:20.827
That's why we must
help each other.

2:19:20.852,2:19:22.522
Are you trying to seduce me?

2:19:24.137,2:19:25.930
I don't try.

2:19:26.681,2:19:28.551
I seduce...

2:19:29.600,2:19:31.379
...or I don't.

2:19:33.478,2:19:36.606
I do not have to seduce
with my body.

2:19:37.566,2:19:40.484
I have something
much better than that:

2:19:44.198,2:19:45.741
My country.

2:19:46.742,2:19:49.331
It is the richest
land in the world.

2:19:51.288,2:19:53.823
Egypt and Rome are different.

2:19:54.296,2:19:55.863
Rome is masculine,

2:19:57.203,2:19:59.070
Egypt is feminine.

2:20:01.382,2:20:05.791
Rome, is sunlight, Egypt is twilight.

2:20:06.303,2:20:09.716
But it's not part of Rome, not yet.

2:20:11.850,2:20:16.055
Make me queen, and the East
and West will be united.

2:20:16.730,2:20:22.109
We will be god and goddess
ruling the world.

2:21:01.900,2:21:04.490
You kiss me with
the tongue of a serpent.

2:21:04.532,2:21:07.320
I must test you to see
if you are poison.

2:21:07.362,2:21:10.320
- And am I?
- No, but I can taste Gaul.

2:21:12.077,2:21:16.410
- Will you stay with in Egypt, Caesar?
- What does Egypt have to offer...

2:21:16.452,2:21:20.339
- ...that Rome does not?
- Have you heard of the fertile crescent?

2:21:20.794,2:21:23.880
- Is it a region down below?
- Indeed it is!

2:21:24.373,2:21:25.715
What grows there?

2:21:26.007,2:21:29.551
I believe the region
fertile enough to hut a king.

2:21:29.593,2:21:32.764
If you doubt it, try planting
something there!

2:21:33.306,2:21:35.433
Only promise me one thing.

2:21:35.725,2:21:40.534
When you return to Rome,
you must be fateful to me.

2:21:40.770,2:21:43.814
But I'm married,
I'm already being unfaithful...

2:21:43.856,2:21:46.182
- ...with you!
- Let's go.

2:21:48.679,2:21:51.115
Demand you give yourself to a woman.

2:21:51.241,2:21:55.468
In politics you lie,
like serpent!

2:21:59.575,2:22:01.599
You think that her influence is evil.

2:22:01.781,2:22:04.270
And no one is more
ambitious than she is.

2:22:05.120,2:22:07.474
And she'll do anything
to achieve her ends.

2:22:07.540,2:22:09.495
Some say she's a witch.

2:22:09.537,2:22:11.714
I think you've been skulking
too long in the dark.

2:22:11.734,2:22:14.135
If Caesar wants to be king...

2:22:14.289,2:22:17.467
- ...would you prevent it?
- He doesn't want the crown!

2:22:18.092,2:22:19.352
What if he did?

2:22:21.463,2:22:24.484
Of course I'd do anything
to keep the Kings out of Rome.

2:22:24.601,2:22:27.531
At least with Sulla, the Tyranny
ended with his death.

2:22:29.018,2:22:30.062
With a king...

2:22:30.946,2:22:32.822
...the reign can be
passed on to his son...

2:22:33.067,2:22:34.708
...to another son forever.

2:22:35.152,2:22:37.425
Our ancestors knew too well
what that was like.

2:22:37.669,2:22:40.833
Had your ancestors fought to sent the Kings
outside the city gates,

2:22:40.853,2:22:42.822
they would stop at nothing
to free Rome from them.

2:22:43.834,2:22:45.029
So would I.

2:22:46.971,2:22:48.873
That's what we hoped
to hear you say.

2:22:50.796,2:22:52.470
Is this just conjecture?

2:22:53.084,2:22:55.019
I've heard nothing about this
except from you.

2:22:55.214,2:22:57.418
They were all talking it about, Brutus.

2:22:57.963,2:23:01.849
They say there's nothing between
him and the crown but Cato your uncle.

2:23:04.732,2:23:06.729
Cesar promised me...

2:23:07.781,2:23:10.114
...that he would never kill Cato.

2:23:12.397,2:23:16.446
Do you think Cesar's incapable
of breaking a promise?

2:23:16.822,2:23:19.733
Is it worth trying him
in a matter of such urgency?

2:23:23.167,2:23:27.079
If Cato is killed
and Caesar wants the crown...

2:23:28.159,2:23:29.906
...then I'll be the first to oppose it.

2:23:31.459,2:23:35.385
But I will not prepare myself
against him... until there's proof!

2:23:37.602,2:23:42.688
CATO'S FORT
UTICA, NORTH AFRICA - 46 B.C.

2:24:38.938,2:24:41.867
- Father!
- Where's my sword?

2:24:44.296,2:24:46.868
- I had it removed.
- Why?

2:24:47.444,2:24:50.684
You said before that
if Caesar won the battle...

2:24:50.913,2:24:52.793
- ...you might...
- My own son...

2:24:52.835,2:24:56.233
...would deliver me naked
to the arms of my enemy.

2:24:56.427,2:24:58.135
Your own son wants you to live!

2:24:58.217,2:25:01.893
So, you take away the sword
you take away the choice.

2:25:02.424,2:25:06.798
When did I go mad that you have
to take choices from me...

2:25:07.111,2:25:08.822
...for my own protection!

2:25:09.187,2:25:11.807
Am I your father or your son?

2:25:13.666,2:25:15.725
Why don't you bind
my hands as well...

2:25:16.150,2:25:18.732
...so I can't defend myself at all?

2:28:22.625,2:28:25.913
- We'll bury him with honors.
- I'll bury him myself.

2:28:26.372,2:28:28.963
Let the state celebrate his life.

2:28:29.005,2:28:31.084
Which state? Rome?

2:28:31.794,2:28:33.937
The Rome of Caesar?

2:28:34.588,2:28:37.675
To accept your honors
would defile my name.

2:28:38.231,2:28:40.855
And on behalf of
my father and my family,

2:28:41.011,2:28:43.002
I decline.

2:28:46.517,2:28:49.586
Now I'm asking you
to leave this room.

2:29:37.829,2:29:40.740
We should speak of Cato as a god.

2:29:41.505,2:29:44.138
He killed himself so he
wouldn't be brought down...

2:29:44.158,2:29:47.717
...by the hand of
the lesser man... Caesar.

2:29:49.251,2:29:51.521
The higher we lift Cato's name...

2:29:52.563,2:29:54.929
...the lower Caesar's will sink.

2:29:55.084,2:29:58.291
Still... we must appear
to be rallying support.

2:29:59.421,2:30:00.563
No.

2:30:01.906,2:30:05.763
No, it's an art to plant ideas
in the heads of others.

2:30:06.775,2:30:11.650
And a man is never so resolved as it is
when he thinks a conviction is his own.

2:30:12.733,2:30:15.296
That's why we need
Brutus on our side.

2:30:15.829,2:30:19.092
It wouldn't be mixed in with the cause
if it burned the good one.

2:30:20.659,2:30:22.373
They listen to him.

2:30:22.824,2:30:26.028
What if he won't...
mix in with our cause?

2:30:28.078,2:30:32.427
I think I know how to soften Brutus...

2:30:33.951,2:30:35.848
...but I will need your help.

2:30:42.557,2:30:45.775
There is no peace in the world
like in my house.

2:30:50.392,2:30:51.575
Calpurnia...

2:30:54.063,2:30:56.105
...would you greet
your husband with a kiss?

2:30:59.669,2:31:00.996
Dismiss them.

2:31:21.012,2:31:24.687
Can't a man return to his home and expect
a warmer mood from his wife?

2:31:25.567,2:31:28.155
How could you bring her to Rome?

2:31:34.725,2:31:36.476
It was for the good of the state.

2:31:38.236,2:31:40.486
Cleopatra rules
a large part of Africa.

2:31:40.528,2:31:41.724
And all of you.

2:31:42.980,2:31:44.961
No one rules me, Calpurnia.

2:31:47.133,2:31:49.124
Not Cleopatra, not even you.

2:31:52.700,2:31:55.841
But what I want is the love that
you promised me when we married.

2:31:55.883,2:31:57.122
You can't have it.

2:31:57.545,2:32:00.670
You can have my obedience,
you can have my loyalty,

2:32:01.574,2:32:03.742
but I cannot love
those who dishonor me.

2:32:03.803,2:32:05.415
No one can dishonor you.

2:32:05.802,2:32:08.194
You're right, I dishonored myself...

2:32:08.657,2:32:10.394
...when I gave my vows
to you in marriage.

2:32:10.436,2:32:12.769
You made a good marriage,
you're Caesar's wife!

2:32:12.773,2:32:14.819
I should have married a man
other than Caesar,

2:32:15.121,2:32:16.850
that would have been
a good marriage.

2:32:17.279,2:32:21.450
So I wouldn't have had to watch my husband
perform for Egypt every night,

2:32:21.565,2:32:24.818
in order to keep the riches
of that land flowing into Rome!

2:32:25.360,2:32:28.787
Between you and Cleopatra,
I don't know who is the concubine!

2:32:29.406,2:32:32.823
Retain your dignity, there's a limit
to what I'll hear from you.

2:32:34.953,2:32:36.998
I have no dignity left.

2:32:40.250,2:32:42.878
Perhaps... I ought to buy some.

2:32:44.171,2:32:48.520
Maybe I should learn, like you have,
that you can be bought and sold.

2:32:48.759,2:32:52.012
What's the price? What's the price
of consulship these days?

2:32:52.304,2:32:54.240
What's the price of being king?

2:32:57.601,2:33:01.067
When did your hope of bringing
a vision to the people...

2:33:01.109,2:33:04.913
...become this lust
for power itself?

2:33:12.657,2:33:14.705
Was it when Julia died?

2:33:26.588,2:33:29.599
I have nowhere else to go
so I'll stay here...

2:33:31.301,2:33:35.186
...but I'll live apart from you,
not as man and wife.

2:33:38.308,2:33:41.787
May the gods forgive me
for breaking my marriage vows,

2:33:42.394,2:33:45.065
as I pray they forgive you
for breaking yours.

2:34:03.458,2:34:05.720
You're an early riser, Brutus.

2:34:07.421,2:34:08.636
So are you.

2:34:09.046,2:34:10.810
Lately I am.

2:34:12.550,2:34:16.091
I couldn't sleep last night
worrying about the honor of your name.

2:34:19.890,2:34:22.065
Do you know something about these?

2:34:24.061,2:34:26.897
I know the writing,
but don't ask me who wrote them.

2:34:27.189,2:34:30.410
Minds change quickly
in these troubled times,

2:34:30.452,2:34:33.062
and I take you to forever
doubt these men.

2:34:33.904,2:34:36.331
Oh, Brutus I've done my best
to persuade them...

2:34:36.351,2:34:38.118
...that you are a man of honor,

2:34:38.325,2:34:41.630
though you wouldn't pledge
to keep Caesar from becoming king.

2:34:41.672,2:34:44.590
I gave you my pledge that
I'd oppose him in the Senate.

2:34:46.755,2:34:50.416
But some among us feel that to oppose
a man like Caesar with words...

2:34:50.436,2:34:52.645
...is the same thing
as handing him the crown.

2:34:52.673,2:34:55.759
I try to use words before
the sword, Cassius,

2:34:56.009,2:34:58.064
just as I try to use reason
before passion.

2:34:58.440,2:35:01.731
People say, calling on reason
before passion can lead to idleness,

2:35:02.224,2:35:04.731
and sometimes action is required.

2:35:05.396,2:35:07.140
But I know you're a decent man,

2:35:07.438,2:35:11.777
and that your meek and gentle nature
is how you feel you best serve the good.

2:35:11.797,2:35:14.339
I'm not gentle in
defending my beliefs,

2:35:14.653,2:35:18.644
but you have given me no proof
that Caesar will demand the crown.

2:35:19.491,2:35:22.666
Do you plan to be at the Senate
at the Calends of March?

2:35:22.708,2:35:24.293
No, I'll be here.

2:35:24.329,2:35:28.472
They say that on that day Caesar
will move that he be made king.

2:35:32.462,2:35:34.104
I will come if I am sent for.

2:35:35.423,2:35:37.013
This is what they mean.

2:35:37.551,2:35:39.429
People say that this is weakness,

2:35:39.449,2:35:41.925
to come when you are summoned
and at no other time.

2:35:41.967,2:35:44.781
To accept the favors
of a tyrant like Caesar.

2:35:44.823,2:35:47.691
- He spared my life!
- And he took the life of Cato...

2:35:47.811,2:35:50.926
...your wife's father,
who treated you like a son.

2:35:56.111,2:35:58.293
Has she ceased her mourning?

2:35:59.072,2:36:01.624
No, and neither have I.

2:36:02.617,2:36:06.987
- So you're grieving over Cato's death.
- Cassius, yes I'm grieving!

2:36:07.622,2:36:11.186
But private affection and public duty
are not the same thing.

2:36:12.252,2:36:17.558
And yet they say that in your grief,
you just weep and say prayers...

2:36:17.600,2:36:20.606
...and fill your wife's
drinking cup and go to bed...

2:36:21.261,2:36:24.147
...and when Caesar comes to you
tonight you'll be like his boy...

2:36:24.167,2:36:26.795
- ...and fill his cup as well.
- Oh, who is saying this? Who?

2:36:27.517,2:36:30.322
I don't act for Caesar!

2:36:30.812,2:36:34.114
I act for Rome! Always for Rome!

2:36:36.276,2:36:38.318
Brutus, I've done everything
to convince them...

2:36:38.338,2:36:40.867
...that you're a man of action
and that you love Rome.

2:36:40.971,2:36:43.880
I've spoken in your behalf many times
singing your praises...

2:36:43.900,2:36:46.286
...and condemning those
who speak against you, but...

2:36:47.751,2:36:49.289
...some men have ideas.

2:36:49.581,2:36:53.716
They think highly of those who gave
their lives to expel the kings from Rome.

2:36:53.736,2:36:56.971
Your ancestors!
And they were only men...

2:36:57.838,2:36:59.112
...not gods.

2:37:19.861,2:37:22.280
- Please don't stay.
- I am staying.

2:37:22.572,2:37:26.206
- Why do you want to torment yourself?
- I won't be tormented.

2:37:27.034,2:37:28.452
Will he?

2:37:30.371,2:37:32.540
Isn't that what you wanted to do?

2:37:32.748,2:37:34.466
It will be the best thing for Rome.

2:37:36.127,2:37:40.481
I don't trust that you or any other man
knows what's best for Rome.

2:37:40.797,2:37:42.539
I will take my seat.

2:37:42.967,2:37:46.278
A woman has a right
to see a bride, doesn't she?

2:37:46.595,2:37:48.109
Calpurnia!

2:37:49.014,2:37:50.057
Portia.

2:38:01.610,2:38:05.489
Romans, we're here to celebrate
the return of Caesar!

2:38:07.671,2:38:13.167
His return, not only with Her Majesty
Cleopatra, but with Egypt itself.

2:38:13.334,2:38:16.433
For he has transformed the richest land
in the known world.

2:38:16.596,2:38:18.808
It is now not only Egypt.

2:38:19.378,2:38:22.384
It is Egypt... and it is Rome!

2:38:28.847,2:38:42.951
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

2:38:50.784,2:38:52.548
I've said before...

2:38:53.787,2:38:55.831
...and I will say again:

2:38:57.165,2:38:59.668
I will not be king of Rome!

2:39:00.419,2:39:02.182
I an only Caesar!

2:39:02.754,2:39:04.679
I need no crown...

2:39:06.716,2:39:08.732
...to act on your behalf!

2:39:13.328,2:39:23.232
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

2:39:54.813,2:40:08.822
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

2:40:31.175,2:40:34.584
Do you still believe that ours
is not just cause?

2:40:37.473,2:40:38.890
I'm with you.

2:40:42.103,2:40:44.316
We have to act soon.

2:44:01.550,2:44:05.179
We will wait till Caesar
brings the Senate to order.

2:44:05.933,2:44:08.325
Lepidus will call for the elections.

2:44:08.724,2:44:12.770
Casca, you will ask Caesar
to consider the petitions first.

2:44:13.187,2:44:16.830
You, Cassius,
will step behind Caesar.

2:44:18.609,2:44:22.247
No man should go for his blade...

2:44:22.571,2:44:25.084
...until we're all within reach of Caesar.

2:44:25.573,2:44:28.925
Every knife must enter
Caesar's body...

2:44:30.044,2:44:31.389
...at least once.

2:44:33.082,2:44:35.896
And if... we fail,

2:44:37.044,2:44:39.880
or if our plot is discovered
before we even begin,

2:44:40.506,2:44:43.558
then we turn our knives on ourselves...

2:44:44.467,2:44:45.851
...without hesitation.

2:44:47.486,2:44:48.872
We all agreed?

2:44:49.324,2:44:53.018
Go to the Senate. I will meet
with Caesar at Cleopatra's house.

2:44:56.605,2:44:58.023
Go.

2:45:34.559,2:45:35.874
Brutus...

2:45:37.395,2:45:38.959
...why are you pacing like that?

2:45:39.437,2:45:41.078
I'm concerned we'll be late.

2:45:41.232,2:45:42.470
Caesar!

2:45:44.486,2:45:46.404
Calpurnia, what are you doing here?

2:45:48.156,2:45:51.271
I had a dream last night!
Please don't go out today!

2:45:52.452,2:45:55.455
I'll come to you later,
at our home.

2:45:55.747,2:45:58.514
I saw you slaughtered,
in your own blood!

2:46:00.335,2:46:02.136
It was horrible!

2:46:02.879,2:46:06.674
Well, I cannot let dreams
or flights of birds direct my actions.

2:46:07.192,2:46:11.179
I can't let you go. I swallow my pride
today to come to you,

2:46:11.387,2:46:15.051
because your life is more important to me
than my pride. Now you listen to me...

2:46:15.093,2:46:17.402
The Senate is convened for the consul.

2:46:19.812,2:46:22.648
They can't conduct one day
of business without their Caesar?

2:46:23.858,2:46:26.009
There are matters on the agenda...

2:46:26.571,2:46:28.801
...which can only be
dealt with by you Caesar.

2:46:28.821,2:46:31.828
- They can wait a day!
- And what should I tell the Senate?

2:46:32.325,2:46:35.593
That their consul is at home,
because his wife has had a bad dream?

2:46:38.998,2:46:43.699
As... your friend, Caesar,
I have to advise you on this.

2:46:45.004,2:46:47.594
You called the Senate together.

2:46:48.215,2:46:52.196
Show them you're a man of intention,
meet with your Senate.

2:46:53.721,2:46:55.732
They're waiting for your guidance.

2:47:00.478,2:47:02.191
I'll be with him lady.

2:47:03.105,2:47:04.821
I'll never leave his side.

2:47:14.200,2:47:15.964
I'll come to you later.

2:47:58.285,2:47:59.725
Hail, Caesar!

2:48:00.010,2:48:01.749
Hail, Caesar!

2:48:23.101,2:48:24.495
Portia.

2:48:28.440,2:48:30.497
I'm not fit to be alone today.

2:48:34.446,2:48:35.798
Sit down.

2:48:36.573,2:48:40.082
- Bring us some wine!
- Yes, let's have some wine.

2:48:41.870,2:48:43.719
What business do we have today?

2:48:45.623,2:48:49.942
Two legal briefings,
an election for a quaestor, and...

2:48:50.434,2:48:52.387
...the petitions from the Senate.

2:48:52.547,2:48:54.434
Let's get the election out of the way.

2:48:55.141,2:48:56.514
The election!

2:49:00.597,2:49:02.197
I move we...

2:49:03.827,2:49:06.538
...take the petitions, first.

2:49:06.810,2:49:09.016
I called for the election,
the election will commence.

2:49:09.731,2:49:11.130
But...

2:49:11.941,2:49:15.591
...Marcus Octavius, who is running
for the office, is not yet here.

2:49:16.529,2:49:19.327
Petitioners, then. Approach!

2:49:25.163,2:49:27.855
I'm glad Caesar is with Brutus today.

2:49:28.875,2:49:30.383
Why?

2:49:30.918,2:49:33.963
Last night I dreamt,
he was stabbed to death.

2:50:06.411,2:50:07.590
Brutus...

2:50:19.800,2:50:20.924
Caesar,

2:50:21.861,2:50:25.560
I ask mercy
for my exiled brother.

2:50:25.889,2:50:29.304
Why are you petitioning what
so recently has been denied?

2:50:39.328,2:50:40.949
Who is the next petitioner?

2:50:44.241,2:50:47.267
I want to ask mercy for my father,
who has been put in jail.

2:50:47.453,2:50:50.622
I ruled your father be
in prison and my word is law.

2:50:53.208,2:50:54.560
Old man!

2:50:55.085,2:50:58.125
You said something ill will befall
Caesar on the Ides of March.

2:50:58.505,2:51:00.924
Well, nothing has happened yet,
though the ides have come.

2:51:01.216,2:51:05.199
They have come,
but they've not yet gone.

2:51:12.519,2:51:16.083
I want to ask for your pardon,
my great Caesar.

2:51:18.108,2:51:21.042
And I pray for your soul.

2:51:33.331,2:51:34.930
Stop it!

2:51:38.336,2:51:39.512
Caesar!

2:52:02.235,2:52:03.945
Caesar has been slain!

2:52:31.013,2:52:32.265
Brutus...

2:54:39.572,2:54:44.830
AFTER CAESAR'S DEATH, ROME WAS PLUNGED
IN 15 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR

2:54:45.202,2:54:48.578
CAESAR'S KILLERS HAVEN'T SURVIVED
FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS

2:54:48.620,2:54:51.772
NONE OF THEM DIED
OF NATURAL CAUSES

2:54:52.207,2:54:57.171
CASSIUS FELL BY THE SAME DAGGER
THAT HE HAD DIRECTED AGAINST CAESAR

2:54:57.629,2:55:02.429
BRUTUS TOOK HIS OWN LIFE
THE SAME WAY AS HIS UNCLE CATO

2:55:02.885,2:55:08.930
PORTIA LOST HER MIND OVER BRUTUS' DEATH
SHE KILLED HERSELF BY SWALLOWING HOT COALS

2:55:09.363,2:55:13.200
MARCUS ANTONIUS
AND CLEOPATRA FELL IN LOVE

2:55:13.220,2:55:16.378
WHEN AUGUSTUS, CAESAR'S SUCCESSOR,
TRIED TO CAPTURE HER, SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE.

2:55:16.867,2:55:22.765
THE SON OF CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA
MURDERED AT AUGUSTUS' COMMAND

2:55:23.161,2:55:29.249
CALPURNIA NEVER MARRIED AGAIN
